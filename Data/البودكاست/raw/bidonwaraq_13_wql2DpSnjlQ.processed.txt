and for me personally 
I remember that night
very clearly.
I was in the operation room
and I sat
and there was
you know like a 
Reconciliation in some way, 
with the idea that
I will probably not
get out of this war.
I mean
I reached a conviction
at that time that
all the choices I took
in my life
and all the path I took
in my life reached me to a point
that I am proud of
but
everything in the world has a price
and the price of this
life that I chose
that I will not get out of
this war.
Good evening, And welcome to "Bidon Waraq"
In Bidon Waraq we are interested in discussing topics that matter to us, the Arab community
That's why today, Dr. Ghassan Abustta was invited to Kuwait by the "Bidon Waraq" podcast 
Today, our discussion is with Dr. Ghassan Abustta, who has 30 years of experience in the field of war medicine.
He has been present since the Second Intifada in Palestine until today, covering all the wars that have occurred in Palestine
as well as wars in the Arab world such as Yemen, Syria, and Iraq 
We aim to benefit from his experience as a war doctor and compare the scale of atrocities that occur continuously in Gaza
highlighting the differences between previous wars and the latest one in Gaza
We also discussed the targeting of the healthcare sector by Zionist entity before October 7th the importance of targeting the healthcare sector
 as it is a vital institution of the state
We explored the scientific and objective differences between South African apartheid and Zionist apartheid
It is important to note that the support and participation of you as followers and contributors to the Bidon Waraq podcast
whether on an individual level or from supporting companies, have led to our expansion in terms of guests and topics
This support must continue for us to expand further and have a stronger presence in the Arab world
We aim to address key issues and attract them through the “Bidon Waraq” podcast 
With that said, I hope you enjoy this episode
My name is Faisal Alaqel and this is “Bidon Waraq” 
Ok, this is rolling, this is rolling, are you sure it's rolling?
Yes, yes, yes.
In the name of God.
The sound.
The sound is also rolling.
Yes.
Three channels, one, two, three channels.
Ok.
To make sure we don't have to record this again
Yes
Welcome, doctor.
Welcome to Kuwait.
This is your country after all, you don’t need someone to tell you.
Thank you.
God bless you.
Yes.
Doctor, we were talking to you before recording this episode.
You told me the last time you came to Kuwait, for a long stay, was in 1989.
Yes.
Then you left.
And in the last two days I picked you up, and went on a few trips with you.
Did Kuwait change anything for you?
Of course it has changed.
But there are somethings that are different.
Today we passed by the Salhiya market.
And my father's clinic, the building where the clinic was at in Safarat Square is still there.
Yes.
I want to go and see the house that we spent the last seven years in before we traveled.
It is still there.
The school is still there.
The sports club is still there.
So, there are still places that one remembers.
And if one always starts in the sea street, the Gulf street, he can reach all the places he needs.
Amazing.
Right.
I want to go back seven years, before 1989, to 1982.
In the summer of 1982, there was an Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the siege of Beirut.
This helped to increase your political awareness.
There was also a general influence in Kuwait, especially Naji Al-Ali, in the formation of your political awareness.
And I also take your words as you are a writer, that “anyone who lived in Kuwait during that period knew that Naji Al-Ali had a great influence in his political awareness.
Because Naji was always linking politics to the oppressed normal person, and the Palestinian cause by linking it the cause of the oppressed Palestinian individual.
I want to know the general atmosphere in 1982, which you chose this date, in particular, where your political awareness was shaped.
Why did you choose this date?
I remember in the evening of the 4th of June, I was at home watching TV.
We went down to Baghdad street in Al-Salmiyah.
And there was a scene of the Israeli tanks entering south of Lebanon, and a scene of the Israeli raids on Beirut and on most of the facilities.
Then it was discovered that the first facilities targeted by the Israelis were the hospitals of the Palestinian Red Crescent.
And then, Kuwaiti TV had a huge role in covering up the war.
And there were donations being gathered.
There were campaigns and there were advertisements for them between each program and the other on Kuwaiti TV.
At that time, there were two stations, an Arabic station and an English station.
So, the general atmosphere in Kuwait was an atmosphere of solidarity.
And there are two things that I always mention.
First, the view of Kuwaiti women in a queue in front of the office of the Liberation Organization at Hawalli (an area in Kuwait).
They were donating their gold during the war.
And the second scene that I want to mention, or the second memory, is the number of families in Kuwait that were Palestinian or Kuwaiti families who during the summer canceled their weddings.
To that extent?
Because of the very high impact on the tragedy on them
People were embarrassed to hold their weddings during the summer.
And I remember several families who canceled their weddings so that there is no need to say that there is joy during that invasion.
Personally, the experience was when I was 13 years old.
There were scenes of injuries, scenes of attacks on hospitals, and there were scenes that they called RPG children, who were a little older than me.
So, one began to understand these two parts of the Palestinian struggle, the part related to medicine and the part related to the struggle.
So, it was a summer.
I remember that at the end of the summer, we returned to school on the first of September.
And on the third week of September, there was a massacre of Sabra and Shatila when we were at school.
So, during all this summer, the most recent point for me was the awareness that politics and the tragedy of our people will be an essential part of my personal decisions.
Why did you decide to do medicine when you had political awareness?
Why didn't you go directly to politics?
Why medicine specifically?
Look, for one to deny the social influence of this..
I mean my father was a doctor.
The Palestinian society considered that a graduate student who is academically superior must study medicine or engineering.
So, there was this part.
But for me, there was a rejection of this idea.
May my father rest in peace
I tried to convince him more than once that I want to study political science or philosophy.
Then, at the end, I remember a day when we sat down and he asked me,
If you have a political science or engineering certificate
What do you want to do when you go?
If you have a medical certificate, you have the ability to have a positive impact on people's lives.
If you have political awareness, you have the ability to understand what you see as a doctor.
At that time, there was a conviction that the decision to study medicine was a political decision rather than a decision to escape politics.
You had efforts in..
Doctor, the first time you went and worked during the war on Palestine was during the second intifada.
Then you went many times, even before the last war.
You went in 2019, 2021, 2014, 2007,correct me if I’m wrong, and other events.
You also had efforts in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq, in terms of dealing with the events that occur during the war.
During your presence in Iraq and Syria, you said that you can learn from medical practice in analysis and impact more than any political practice.
What can you learn from this practice more than any political practice?
What distinguishes medicine is that it allows you, and people allow you as a doctor, to enter their lives with details that no other job allows you.
I remember when I was in Lebanon at the American University, and we had a program to treat war injuries for children.
Most of the children who came to us were from the Syrian war.
What I used to see at the clinic when the injured family came with the injured child, was the impact of the war on the family.
How the Syrian refugee family in Lebanon was like, the difficulties they were facing, the ways of treatment,
the political manifestations of daily life for people, which are translated into health effects.
If a person has the awareness and the ability to see what is in front of him, medicine allows you to see things that no other job allows you to see.
I would like to talk about the doctor who inspired you to work in the field of war medicine and conflicts.
Dr. Suchi, a British Doctor from Malaysian origins.
In the field of war medicine, I would like to make a digression.
People may say that Dr. Ghassan Abou Setta is a Plastic & Reconstructive Surgeon.
A cosmetic doctor is a job related to material life.
However, there is a relationship between war and cosmetic medicine.
I would like to look into this idea.
Why did you specialize in cosmetic medicine and what is its relationship with wars?
Dr. Sui, who became a close friend of mine.
I remember when I was in the Faculty of Medicine, Dr. Sui Yang volunteered during the siege of Beirut.
She witnessed the massacre of Sabra and Shatila.
She was in Gaza hospital in Sabra when the massacre took place.
After the massacre, during the first Intifada (uprising), she volunteered and worked in my family's hospital during that time.
I had the opportunity and the honor to go with her to Gaza during the war of 2008-2009.
Coincidentally, I worked with her in the same hospital in Britain.
When there were several underground explosions in London in 2005,
we were working in the same hospital and more than 200 wounded came to the hospital from the explosions.
Dr. Sui was physically weak.
She was four feet tall and she was a Chinese lady.
However, her determination, persistence, and amazing dedication to the Palestinian cause to this day,
not only did I find her inspiring for my life, but everyone who meets her finds her an inspiring person.
She was a war surgeon, an orthopedic surgeon,
a war surgeon who were among the most surgeons who influenced the scientific literature and scientific research for war wounds.
She wrote several medical books on war wounds.
Her determination, despite being in her mid-seventies, still has a positive impact on my life and my family's life.
As for cosmetic surgery, it is related to people's minds in the cosmetical way.
However, there is a fundamental part of cosmetic surgery that is restorative too.
Thank God, one of the things that I was able to do academically,
because when I moved to the American University in Beirut,
for the first time in my life, I was able to link the academic research part to war surgery.
Because the American University, due to its history as the main hospital in the civil war,
in the raids, and in the war of 2006, became a target for the war wounds in Iraq.
Then, in 2011, for the Syrian war wounds.
So, there was an academic part in the work that I was able to do at the American University in Beirut.
So, it allowed me to develop the idea of the main part of the role of cosmetic surgery in the literature of war surgery, especially the scientific one.
It allowed me during my time at the American University develop this
there are only two books, medical books, about the restoration of war wounds.
One is called Restoration of War Wounds, and the other is called Treating War Children.
These two books, thank God, we were able to write them based on this experience.
So, one feels that these ten years that I spent at the American University,
allowed me to try to take cosmetic surgery more towards the fact that it’s a main part of the restoration of war wounds.
So, Professor, you went to the second intifada, and the wars that we talked about, and you stayed in it.
Before we dive into the Aqsa flood (7th of October events), I am mainly interested in understanding the general context of the medical sector in Palestine,
whether we are talking about the West Bank, or Jerusalem, or Gaza.
Why are they isolated from each other?
I want to understand the general atmosphere of the medical sector,
and how today there is a direct attempt to dismantle this medical sector
and its details.
We say that they are trying to dismantle it,
but it is important to understand how they are dismantling it, and why they are dismantling it.
The Palestinian health sector, due to the occupation,
had a policy of deliberate non-development,
To not invest in the health sector,
in order to benefit the Israeli health sector from the Palestinian patients.
After the First Gulf War,
there was a separation between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank,
and people lost the ability to move freely from the Gaza Strip to Jerusalem, to the West Bank.
Before that, it was normal.
Before that, it was normal, and that is why Al-Maqasid Hospital,
which is in Kuwait, was one of the main financiers.
I remember in the 1980s, when Al-Maqasid Hospital was established in Jerusalem,
the doctors of Al-Maqasid Hospital were from the State of Kuwait,
from the Ministry of Health in Kuwait,
as employees of the Ministry of Health in Kuwait,
including Dr. Mostafa Abdel Shafi, the brother of Dr. Haider.
Al-Maqasid Hospital was the main specialized hospital,
and the wounded and the sick came from the West Bank and from Gaza to Al-Maqasid Hospital.
The beginning of the separation and apartheid of the West Bank from the Gaza Strip
began during the Gulf War, and it continued, and its tension increased.
When the Oslo Accords happened, the Israelis helped to double this seperation.
How?
The permit system.
The permit system, when you want to move from Gaza to the West Bank,
or move from Gaza to Jerusalem,
you have to apply for a permit from the Israeli authorities,
from the Israeli security agencies,
to leave the Gaza Strip, even if you are sick.
The permit system is the main part that the Israelis used to violate the health sector,
because the freedom of movement of patients and groups is a major part of the needs of the health sector.
So, if you prevented the patient from going from Gaza to Jerusalem,
or from the West Bank to Gaza,
you will force the health sector to make a separate health sector in the Gaza Strip,
and then another separate health sector in East Jerusalem,
and a separate health sector in the West Bank.
So, you will need three times the resources.
Exactly, and you will not have the human resources to create this,
especially due to the piracy of the health sector,
which is that the specialized hospitals,
are less in number because they need more resources.
So, you are creating three health sectors,
instead of creating one complete and more effective health sector.
Over the years of the Oslo accord the health sector has weakened,
despite the fact that the health file was the first file taken over by the Palestinian Authority during Oslo.
The Palestinian Authority failed to create a health sector
for several reasons,
in my opinion, some of which are related to the vision of the Palestinian Authority
for the state's gains or the state's shortcomings.
So, the focus was on the institutions, not on human development.
The focus was on treatment at any cost,
through medical evacuation,
instead of focusing on creating a health sector
whose function is to resist partition and the resistance of Israeli policies.
So, after 2006,
and the arrival of enthusiasm to block the security and political control over the Gaza Strip,
the increase of the blockade
made the Israelis control all the that enters and exits the Gaza Strip,
and they began to use the blockade to strangulate the Gaza Strip and to kill the Gaza Strip.
The blockade of medical resources
and the blockade of the exit of patients for treatment
was a major part of the blockade policies.
I will give you a very simple example.
In the operating room for orthopedic surgery,
there is a radiation device
that you need in the operating room
so that when the Orthopedic surgeon puts the screws or the rods,
he can do this and see if the bone has returned to normal.
The "Doctors Without Borders" organization,
which is one of the largest humanitarian organizations in the world,
wanted to insert one device from these devices to the hospital in Jabalia.
It took 18 months to insert the device.
To insert this main device?
Yes, it was an X-ray device, not a CT scan.
It was just a basic radiation device.
At any time, the list of medicines that the World Health Organization put
only a third of them were in the Gaza Strip.
The other side of the blockade
was that 40% of the patients' permits were rejected.
Some of them had cancer and were dying
due to their inability to reach the Palestinian health sector
in the West Bank or in Jerusalem.
What did the Israelis say?
When they were rejected,
and it is up to you to ask why they were rejected,
maybe they were only rejected just like that,
But when there are international organizations
that support the “Doctors Without Borders” organization,
Shouldn’t they not have the power to reject this device
and try to insert it as soon as possible.
I would like to know the details of these ideas.
What do they say in return?
There are two ways.
One way is that you say anything you do not like
that this is a dual use.
Now, in this war,
Israel has banned the entry of mobile operating rooms
with trucks on solar energy.
It has banned its entry because it has decided
that solar energy chips can be used in dual use.
The modern break-ins are made of graphite.
It is forbidden to enter because graphite is considered a dual use.
They are looking for any reason so that they do not allow them to enter.
Or the bureaucratic use of any request.
They say,
I did not tell you,
I am waiting,
I am studying your request,
12 months, 20 months,
and I am waiting.
The third part, the general part,
is the economic strangulation of the Gaza Strip
and making life difficult in the Gaza Strip
to convince the medical staff to emigrate.
The Israeli policies are against the medical staff
who always have the ability to work outside the Gaza Strip.
This was also part of the policies.
Now, one of the positive things that the Ministry of Health was able to do,
especially after the 2008-2009 war,
is that there was a lot of investment in human resources
and the emigration of doctors outside Palestine for specialization.
Two years before the war,
a lot of medical staff were emigrated to Qatar,
to Hamed Hospital for specialization,
or to Jordan, or to Malaysia.
There was an investment
and the medical staff began to return during the last phase before the war.
Do you want me to turn down the volume?
No, no.
We are talking about why it is important for the Zionist entity to destroy the health sector.
In the end, the health sector, or the medical sector,
does not pose a threat as a weapon.
There is no direct threat
that could be in any of the operations that threaten Israeli life.
But there may be another point of view.
So, I want to understand why it is important for them to destroy this sector.
There are two parts.
The main part is the destruction of any institution.
Israelis fear that any institution could be the nucleus to a state.
The Palestinian health sector is the nucleus to a Palestinian state.
So, the destruction and disintegration of it is destruction of a Palestinian state as the main part.
The second part is that the goal for Gaza
is to make it a city where people live a less than a life, but at the same time not to the extent of death.
During the years of the siege,
the life of the Palestinians in Gaza remains a barrier between life and death.
The disaster is that there is a decision of committing genocide now
to make the life go into the stage of death.
But during the preparatory phase of the current siege,
the life of Gazans remains a barrier between life and death.
He does not die, but he does not live.
And the health sector is an essential part of one of the tools to preserve this life.
If we compare apartheid
or the racial discrimination in South Africa
with the racial discrimination in Palestine today,
and some people say that this is true,
but what I understood is that the method is different.
How can we differentiate between the racial discrimination in South Africa and Palestine?
The main difference between the two,
and the two are based on the idea that they are a European Colonial settlement,
is that South Africa needed its labor, for the workers
to work in mines.
So the South African worker should be kept healthy to a decent extent
to be economically effective in serving the needs of the South African labor market.
The Zionist movement separated the hand of the Palestinian worker
from the Jewish economy before 1948,
and then the Israeli economy from the beginning.
So the Israeli capital does not need the hand of the Palestinian worker
to be able to work, or even succeed,
or to be able to produce profit.
In my opinion, what is happening now,
the genocide,
is rooted in this difference,
that the Israeli, from the beginning of the Zionist project,
had more of a genocide than the project of Pretoria in South Africa,
because they did not need the hand of the Palestinian worker.
So it was closer to the colonial settlement that took place in America or Australia.
In America, when you see what happened,
the indigenous people were exterminated,
and then Africans were brought as slaves,
to do what they could do if they enslaved the indigenous people.
But it was necessary to exchange the indigenous people,
and then bring a cheap worker as a slave.
And Israel is closer to the Australian and American model,
than it is to the South African model.
Yes.
That is why I would like to ask the question,
regarding the snipers, doctor.
The Israeli snipers,
when they were and still are of course,
but before October 7,
they were targeting the Palestinians in their junctures.
Why didn't they kill them directly?
Why did they target them in the junctures?
If you remember, during the return marches,
which is a phase over two years, since 2018,
of the weekly demonstrations,
in the areas of the barbed wire,
which separates the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian territories of 1948.
These demonstrations,
as I said, the strange thing about them,
is that 8,000 young Palestinians were targeted,
by the snipers, in the junctures.
Not to kill them,
but to disable them.
And the idea was related to what we talked about,
about this barrier,
which is related to a society,
which lives a poor life.
And these patients,
the injury was so severe and complicated,
that the rehabilitation
used to take three or four years,
of continuous operations,
approximately 8 to 12 operations,
per patient,
so that they don't lose their limbs.
So, part of the policy of siege and destruction,
is this policy of causing disability,
the policy of causing disability,
and the policy of causing distortion,
and the events of permanent injury,
to distract the society by just surviving.
The Israeli idea is that any society,
that fights for survival,
will not be an initiator,
for the attempt of revolution,
or the attempt of rebellion,
or the attempt of liberation.
So, he will be busy just to live.
Exactly.
Is this the case with the Palestinians?
This was not beneficial with the Palestinians.
This is what made Israelis,
choose the solution of genocide.
In my opinion, the Israelis,
there are two things that happened.
There is a natural evolution of the Israeli society,
with its racism,
and its fascism,
towards the solution of genocide,
or the ultimate last solution.
And what also fed this idea within the Israelis,
was the ideas of Benny Morris.
Benny Morris was a Zionist historian.
The first book he wrote was on the origin,
of the crisis of the Palestinian refugees,
and he was one of the first Israelis,
who started describing the 1948 massacre.
But he did a review ten years later,
and said that the deadly mistake,
committed by the Zionist movement,
that will lead to the collapse of the Zionist project,
is to leave the Palestinians,
in the Gaza Strip,
and the West Bank,
and in Al-Jalil.
And that the only thing that will save,
the Zionist project,
is the completion of all the settler projects,
throughout history,
which is the complete extermination of the indigenous people.
In my opinion,
there is a conviction among the Israeli public,
and among the Israeli leaders,
and the Israeli political elite,
towards the genocidal mindset, or the genocidal state 
that is happening in the war of in Gaza.
And that is what we want to talk about now Doctor.
Its not your first time entering Gaza
Or crossing the Rafah Border between Egypt and Gaza
how did you get the news? 
where were you? I want you to take me with you in throughout that journey 
from the first time you got the news
And you entered after 4 days of what happened there right? Or 3?
3 days.
Well, how did you manage to enter after 3 days,
after the 7th of October war?
And where did you get the news from?
I remember the morning of 7th of October,
like most people,
I turned on the TV,
and I was working at home,
and I couldn't understand the size of what happened.
You couldn't understand,
although you have experience.
Yes, but the crossing of the Palestinian fighters,
on the 7th of October,
surprised me like everyone else,
the size of the crossing,
the size of the Israeli collapse that happened.
Did a collapse happen in your experience?
In my opinion, a collapse happened,
and it was what led to
what we saw
from the Western solidarity
with the Israelis,
I mean the size of the collapse,
the institutional and individual collapse that happened.
On the night of that Saturday,
I reached a conviction
or I realized
the size of what happened,
and I reached a conviction
that the Israeli reaction
will be violent,
because the Israeli
Or what was destroyed
on the 7th of October,
had ability to instill fear
in the hearts
not only of the Palestinian people,
but the people of the region.
So, it was the Israelis responsibility
to return this fear
through a criminal war
Using the Palestinian blood
So, on Saturday night,
I contacted
Doctors Without Borders,
with the Middle East branch
that I always
Had contact with,
I was with them in the war of 1921,
and then in Mosul,
I worked with them.
And I kept the agreement
that since I can,
because I have a Palestinian identity,
to enter through the Rafah Crossing,
I try to enter through the Rafah Crossing,
and to move quickly before the crossing closes.
On Sunday morning,
I got the email that had the ticket.
At 3 o'clock, I took the London-Cairo flight,
and at 10 o'clock at night,
I was in Cairo.
The crossing from Cairo
to the Rafah Crossing
is done through a taxi car
from a licensed company.
At 2 o'clock,
the car moved from Cairo
to the Rafah Crossing,
and at 8 a.m. on October 9,
I was at the gate of the Rafah Crossing.
The Crossing opens
At 9 a.m 
I entered with the first people
who entered,
we were a group of 6 or 7 people,
they were just traveling
and they returned to Gaza.
At 11 a.m.,
I crossed the Egyptian side
and entered the Palestinian side,
and I was in a taxi
heading to Gaza.
Wasn’t there a war? Did they just let you in?
There was a war,
It not about that they let me in, 
It's that there was a rush to enter,
because they knew
that there would be a time when the crossing would be targeted,
and the crossing would close.
So, you were one of the last groups?
Yes, they just wanted to finish from us entering.
On the contrary, it made it easier
to enter, because I felt
that the employees just wanted to finish
these 7 or 8 people and that's it.
Why did you go to Al-Shifa Hospital?
There are several hospitals,
why did you choose Al-Shifa?
During the year and a half
before the war,
I was working on a project
to establish a training program
specializing in the treatment
of cosmetic surgery in Al-Shifa.
So, I had a very
precise knowledge
of the abilities
of the surgeons
and the different levels
of cosmetic surgery section of the hospital,
and
a close relationship
with colleagues
and friends. We worked together
from the war of 2014,
some of them I know from the war of 2014.
So, the decision was to start
with Al-Shifa,
and after that,
we agreed that if they needed me
to go to another hospital,
we could go to another hospital.
On the fifth day, there were
1,100 martyrs
and approximately
5,339
injured.
Here,
the first warning was issued
to the medical team
about the inability to deal with the injured.
Also, there were 11 martyrs
from the medical team.
we are talking about five days later.
Why was the warning issued
from the medical team after five days?
Maybe we won't be able to deal with it.
Because the capacity of all
the health sector was 2,500.
So, you exceeded
the capacity
of the health sector
by double.
At that time, we realized that
what was coming to us was not a flood
but a tsunami of
injured and martyrs
if it kept going on, it will exceed the capacity
of the health sector
to deal with them
I remember that
Al-Shifa hospital,
which is the largest hospital
and has 600 beds.
Within two or three days,
the beds were full.
We started to put patients
on the mattresses in the corridors
of the hospital.
From the beginning?
Yes, from the first week.
Some of the materials
we needed started to run out.
One of the
disinfectant materials
ran out in the first week
due to the huge number of
injuries and burns.
Did you realize at that moment
that this war was different
from the previous wars?
Until now, you did not feel that this war
would be different?
When I arrived in Gaza
in the city of Gaza
in the morning
or midday
of the second day,
The neighborhood of “Al-Rimal” 
Was targeted.
Where my family's house is.
So I had to move
within half an hour
from my arrival
to my cousin's house.
We stayed
all night in her house
and could not reach Al-Shifa hospital
due to the violent
shelling of the Al-Rimal neighborhood.
And usually Al-Rimal wasn’t targeted?
No it was, but not to that extent.
Every minute
the house was shaking.
I realized
that there was not
a shelling
but a systematic destruction
of the whole area.
When I woke up
on the third day and tried to walk
from my house to Al-Shifa hospital,
I began to see the effects of the destruction.
I realized that this destruction
was different from the war of 2014
which was the worst of wars.
Every area of the Al-Rimal
was destroyed.
The entire neighborhood was destroyed
in one night.
You were living with your family as a doctor in
Al-Rimal neighborhood
And at the same time,
they were shelling the street
where you lived
as a Palestinian from Gaza.
How did you react? If you would like to tell me?
That night,
we stayed at home
and could not leave.
My cousin
and her children
and grandchildren were at home.
It was an important mission
for the adults in this war
to calm
the children down
from the chaos
and the shaking that was going on.
And on the morning of the third day,
when there was a little peace,
I took the opportunity
to go to Al-Shifa hospital.
I entered
Al-Shifa hospital
and for
forty days
I was moving
from one hospital to another
in an ambulance.
I entered this war
inside the health sector
and I could not leave.
On the eighth day,
the number of martyrs increased
to 2,215 and thousands of injured.
There was also
a power outage
where electricity was cut
off from the entire Gaza sector
on the eighth day.
The electricity was cut off
and did not come back.
What was the effect of the power outage
on the hospitals
and life in Gaza in general?
The power outage
was also related
to the comprehensive siege
that the Israelis announced
on the eighth of October
that prevented the entry of fuel.
You cut off the electricity
and prevent the entry of fuel
to destroy
All sewage facilities.
You make the hospitals
completely dependent on fuel
so that when
the fuel runs out,
you can destroy the work of the hospitals.
At some point,
I remember,
the Israelis only
targeted
solar energy
on the hospitals
so that all the hospitals
would not have
the ability to operate
when the fuel runs out.
Even solar energy?
Yes, solar energy.
So that when the fuel runs out,
the hospital stops.
It was one of the
main weapons
to destroy the health sector.
On the eighth day
and the ninth day too.
So on the eighth day,
the occupation asked to evacuate the hospital
to prepare for the bombing.
The Jordanian field hospital
also decided
to leave the strip.
But on the ninth day,
the army warned
22 hospitals
and health institutions
with the intention of targeting them.
Finally, they refused to evacuate.
First of all, how did you get these warnings?
And why did you refuse to evacuate?
Two days before
the threat or the warning towards
The hospital of return (al-awda hospital),
I was asked to
Come to the hospital
And to the brothers 
at the hospital. 
Al-awda hospital is a
medium-sized hospital
for one of the civilian labor organizations
in Gaza.
It is located
in the north, in the Jabalia camp.
I worked there
during the second intifada
and the war of 2021
and during the return marches.
There was a unit to in the hospital specialized in rehabilitation
Which was owned by “Doctors without Borders” organization
in partnership with the hospital.
I was in the hospital for two days, 
when I was with Dr. Ahmed Al-Mahanna,
who was
the medical director of the hospital
And who is now detained by the Israelis.
When he received
a phone call
from the Israeli army,
A call from the Israeli army It said 
“This is a the Israeli army speaking You have two hours to evacuate the hospital or we’ll target it."
I was with him in the room.
I asked him
how to evacuate the hospital.
The hospital was full of injured people.
There were 9,200 injured people in Gaza.
Exactly.
He told him that we couldn't evacuate the hospital.
So he said, that they will target the hospital.
After
the phone call was over,
there was a discussion
between us
inside the hospital
and with the Ministry of Health
about a taking a national position
over
this phenomenon
of hospital evacuation.
Everyone
was convinced
that one of the initiatives
for ethnic cleansing
is hospital evacuation.
Jabalia camp will not survive
if you evacuate the hospitals
In Jabalia Camp.
you need political awareness in this case 
to know the intentions behind these threats right?
What is strange about the Israelis
is that because of 75 years
Of unlimited support
from the
Western powers,
the Israelis had a strange phenomenon
in this war.
They were very clear
about
what they wanted
from this war, which was to evacuate
Gazans out of the strip and expel
its population.
So there was a decision not to evacuate
any of the hospitals.
This was repeated in several hospitals,
including the Ahli hospital.
Because until the day
the Ahli hospital was targeted,
there was an Israeli threat.
What happened
was that
there was a decision to
move the patients that have undergone surgeries
the Alshifaa hospital
and the hospital of Return (Al-awda hospital)
would continue its work.
Then
there was a threat to Alshifaa hospital
and the narrative of alshifa hospital
and the Ahly hospital was threatened.
And on the day of the bombing,
they were threatened as well.
You are dealing with an entity
that does not have any trace of decency and is prepared to do anything
However, you stayed at the hospital.
So you didn’t have any problem with that idea.
And what was the response?
We are not leaving 
So if you want to bomb it then do?
It was that we didn’t want to evacuate and it wasn’t possible
Didn’t they tell you that, 
because they were in the media stating
that there were members of “Hamas” inside.
Didn’t they tell you? 
Didn’t they continue 
With the same narrative?
Or was the internal talk different?
Didn’t they ask you to either evict Hamas members 
Or were they at the first place there? 
No, they knew that there weren’t any Hamas members
That’s why they didn’t discuss it with us.
I will give you an example.
This happened in Al-ahli hospital.
When I arrived
to Al-ahli hospital
on the day of the massacre,
Dr. Maher Ayad,
the medical director
of Al-ahli hospital,
the Israeli officer had called him
And told him the message
that he gave
Ahmad Muhanna
That you should evacuate within two hours
And if you do not evacuate,
we will target you.
When he did not evacuate
Al-ahli hospital,
the Israelis fired two missiles
at the external wall of the hospital.
A threat?
A threat. The same officer
called Dr. Maher Ayad
and told him that “I told you
that you must evacuate.”
These two missiles
are just a threat.
Next time, we will hit inside the hospital.
You bear the responsibility
of the people who will
die because of your
refusal to evacuate the hospital.
This is their method and technique, they hold you responsible for their violence.
Of course.
Not only that,
their external narrative
That evacuating the hospitals
was a humanitarian action
to protect
the wounded
from the injury.
It’s the same narrative 
that is being used now
That the world should intervin 
to grant
asylum to the people of Gaza
to protect them from the massacre.
The idea that
you commit a war crime
Inside a shell of humanitarian intervention.
The paradox. 
The audacity.
When you have
the huge
feeling
of the Israelis
when they enter this war
is that they are above the law
because they are protected.
They are protected
even when they confess
of the crime
or they announce
their intention to commit the crime.
They not only announce their intention to commit the crime,
they also announce the reasons
why they want to commit the crime.
They have the feeling
that their alliances
not only with the western governments
but also with the western institutions
and the western media
will give
a fortress
against any
legal or political
action after the war.
That's why the Israelis
like Netanyahu
talked about the Amalek 
ministers
like Dichter
talked about that this is the 
Second Nakba, that they want to
hit Gaza with a nuclear bomb
that they want
to evacuate the residents of Gaza
that they want to use the epidemic diseases
to eradicate the residents of Gaza.
The Israelis were very clear about this.
This made it easier
for the South African team
to prosecute the Israelis
in the
International Court of Justice
that the Israelis were
very clear
Clear or unashamed
Call it what you prefer,
Clear of his intentions.
Doctor, wasn't there
any kind of presence of Hamas 
inside the hospitals?
I mean, not doubt, but
confirmation.
More than anything else.
When it got worse
and worse
Wasn't there some...
I asked myself the same question
during the war
and because
30 years after
being a surgeon during wars
one can
see and know
the way
the fighters behave,
wether the regimental or non-regimental
Fighters, how they behave
in a different way than the rest of the people.
So I was asking, where are the injured
fighters?
And I came to the conclusion
that Hamas or the resistance
had
a military
health system
like the regimental
armies, separated from the health sector.
Most of the
possibilities are inside the tunnels.
Because during the war
we didn't even see the injured
fighters.
And because of the targeting
there wasn't
a public armed presence in the streets.
There wasn't?
No, because they know
that the militants come
and target anyone carrying
even a personal weapon.
So when you move
between them, you don't see a public presence.
Okay Doctor,
on the 10th day of the war,
the 16th day of October,
the occupying planes targeted
UNRWA warehouses
containing foodstuffs and aid.
This is a clear process
To starve
The Palestinians.
I want to understand
The problem with the food, and drinking too
Because at the same time, the resources
in the groundwater were targeted.
I want to understand
the water and food situation
before the 7th of October.
How did these problems
increase when these places were targeted.
Before the 7th of October,
a year or two ago,
the United Nations announced
that 97% of
the groundwater in
the Gaza Strip is not suitable
for human consumption.
The European Union
built a group
of
seawater
desalination centers
to increase
drinking water
in the Gaza Strip.
These
seawater desalination centers
were targeted at the beginning
of the war.
I remember
that what affected us
was that when a person
takes a shower, he feels like
he is bathing in seawater.
The disinfecting machines
of
the hospital
stopped working
because of the salinity of the water
That it depends on
To sterilize the tools and medical equipment.
About the food
at the beginning
of the war,
the Israelis announced
on the 8th of October
that there was a total siege.
All the
consumption
in the Gaza Strip was from what was left inside.
The targeting of the agricultural areas
in the Gaza Strip was to prevent
the arrival of agricultural
products in the Gaza Strip.
From the beginning,
every day was
more difficult than the day before.
There was an increase of
the number of people
going to the supermarket.
I remember
that on the third
or fourth week,
I was going
between Al-Shifa and Al-Ahly
by ambulance.
We passed by a supermarket that was open.
I told the driver
to bring me
a few things if there was
a supermarket because 
I’m Allergic 
to some of the
food items
so I need to compensate for what my body lost.
I entered a supermarket,
one of the biggest supermarkets in Gaza.
There was shampoo,
there was chocolate
for guests,
and
and Schweppes (a drink)
and nuts.
That's it.
The rest was
empty.
From the beginning,
every day,
you feel that everything
was getting worse
in the war.
Medical supplies,
medicine, and food were lessening.
You feel that every day
you are losing your basics.
And
That you’re standing on quicksand
and drowning more in it.
That's it.
Every day is harder,
and you have less supplies.
On October 17th,
the 11th day of the battle,
about 500 Palestinians were martyred
in the biggest massacre
so far
due to the bombing of Al-Ma'madani hospital.
More than 3,000 were martyred
as a group from the beginning of the war.
Israel used
a bomb in Al-Ma'madani hospital
called MK-84
Or Mark-84
I want to understand
what happened that day.
You went to a press conference
and talked about it.
Anyone can watch it on YouTube.
But I want to understand
where you were.
Where you operating in the same hospital?
Why did you go to Al-Ma'madani hospital?
You were in Al-Shifa hospital.
How did you end up in Al-Ma'madani hospital?
And what happened that night?
Two days before the massacre,
due to the high pressure
in Al-Shifa hospital
due to the high number
of injured people,
we felt that
we should try to reduce
the pressure on the injured people
because the operating rooms
were operating at full capacity
and we couldn't
treat the injured people
at the appropriate time.
One of the most important things
in injury treatment
is to admit the injured patient
to the operating room
within the first 24 hours.
When you have patients
in Al-Shifa hospital
who has been injured for 5 or 6 days
and still haven’t been admitted
to the operating room,
So the decision was
That I go to Al-Ahly hospital
and try
to take patients
from Al-Shifa hospital
to reduce the pressure
on the operating rooms of Al-Shifa hospital.
that morning,
the ambulance came
and took me from Al-Shifa hospital
and I went to
Al-Ahly hospital.
When I arrived at the hospital,
just like Al-Shifa hospital,
the hospital
had become a center
for the families
who were fleeing from the bombing.
The hospitals yard
was full of
children and families
sitting in the corners.
The idea behind this is that the hospital was a safe place.
Exactly. It was safe.
Especially Al-Ahly hospital
because of its relationship
with the
International Church Council
and the Anglican Church in Britain.
So, it felt like it was the safest hospital.
I started
to do my operations.
I saw the patients.
We made a list of 10 patients
and 10 patients for the next day.
I started to do my operations.
As I told you,
at 12 o'clock that day
Dr. Maher Ayad,
the medical director,
and Dr. Suhaila Tarazi,
the director of the hospital,
told us about the threats.
He said that
there was a communication
with the church
in Britain.
They assured him
that there was no danger
to the hospital
and that the hospital could continue
its services.
So,
I decided to stay in the hospital
because I had a lot of patients
and I needed to start the next day
early.
It was exactly at aound
6.15 or 6.30 pm.
Where we finished from one of the operations
and we took the patient out.
We took the next patient in
and there was a huge explosion.
Before that, there was the sound of a missile
then a huge explosion.
I didn't know
where the explosion was
but I knew it was in the hospital
because of the intensity of the explosion
the ceiling fell on us.
The first few moments,
I was confused
and I was trying to feel myself
to see if I was injured.
Many of the people around me
were injured from the ceiling
with head injuries.
I checked on everyone
and then I went out
of the operating room
and there was a corridor
leading to the hospital
where the people
I saw that day were.
It was a teerible scene
with the emergency vehicles
on fire
and the fire
was illuminating
the darkness
and
the hospital floor was full of corpses.
Full of corpses
and torn limbs
I still
couldn't
balance
and after a few seconds
I was able to go
to the emergency room.
When I entered the emergency room
on my right, there was a man
in his sixties
who had a
hip injury that has been amputated
and he was bleeding
from what was left
of his thigh.
I took a belt
and tied it to his thigh
to stop the bleeding.
Then I went
and got a bandage
and put it on him
and a shirt
I took from one of the people
around me
to prevent the bleeding again.
Then I moved
to another person.
I was talking to the people
who were holding me
and screaming terrified,
people were injured
corpses
of martyrs around me
everywhere.
Then there was a man
who had a fragment that went inside his neck
and he was
bleeding from his neck
The fragment entered 
in one of the blood vessels.
During that time,
As I said I had to stop the bleeding
and put my hand
on his neck
and press on his vein
to stop the bleeding.
Then the first
rescue team came
and we put him
on the lift
and carried him
with them
to go to the ambulance
and we left
from the yard
While we were
Inside the ambulance car
and at that time
the size of the disaster was seen,
I remember
there was a child's arm
thrown on the ground
while we were carrying
the injured person
to the ambulance
and we moved to Alshifa hospital
to the emergency room
and then
the ambulance came
and at the end
of the day
483 people were martyred
and hundreds of injured
were martyred
in the following days.
I realized that
since you have experience in wars
this is the first time you go through
a similar situation?
Yes, this is the first time
The hospital I was working at was targeted.
As a doctor,
when you are in the hospital
the injured person comes to you.
But you are
next to an injured person
who was injured
within seconds
from your arrival to him.
So you knew that there was no red lines for them.
Exactly.
Not only because it is a hospital
but because of the identity of Alma’madani hospital
I became convinced
that this is an Israeli test
for the international community.
That if I started in this hospital
and I was able to do what I did
and the reaction of the other side was not
forcing me to stop
Then I want to target the whole health sector.
Now, Doctor you know
that in the media
they were trying to promote a certain
narrative that the hospital was a target
at the Islamic Jihad
and so on, but I do not want to go inside this narrative.
I want to get into
The type of.., because this narrative
can be cancelled by just the type of
weapons used
like the white phosphorus
because it should not be used
if there is a target.
This is a target at everyone
and and many more people than just that group.
So I want to understand the type
of the weapon
and how we can understand
the size of the crime through these weapons.
Firstly,
the Israelis
When they threatened
Dr. Maher Ayad
They declared that they want to target the hospital.
This is the first part.
The second part, which you mentioned
that after 30 years
of wars
one has the ability
to tell you
when I see the injury
I can tell you what are the components
of the weapon.
I give you an example. Now, any weapon
will either be explosive
or the main part of
its function is to detonate.
It will either be
burning,
the main part of it is burning,
or it will either be
A fragmentation.
The goal is to injure
the largest number of people
in an exposed area.
From the type
of injuries
that I have seen
on the day
of target
and the injuries 
that I treated at al-shifa
after they were transferred from alma’madani hospital.
I can tell you that this is
a fragmentation missile.
The outer cover
of the missile
is torn into metal rings.
The goal of it is to injure
the largest number of people
in an exposed area.
It does not target
the facilities,
it targets the exposed areas
where there are individuals
and you want to kill the largest number of these individuals.
So,
the man who was
Who 
His thigh
Was amputated,
It’s always during the explosions
that are built only on
the explosive,
Or the explosion.
The amputation occurs in the weak areas
of the body,
which are the joints.
When you think about it,
in the knee,
the body is weaker.
This person
had an amputation 
like the guillotine 
In his thigh,
which is the strongest area of the body,
the thigh bone is strong and wide,
the muscles of the thigh are strong and wide,
but he got amputated
like in a guillotine,
in this area.
The young man who a fragment entered his body,
A metal ring,
all those
around him had
metal fragments in their bodies,
not
dirt and sand
from a bomb explosion
that enters the ground and then explodes
like ordinary bombs.
This bomb
explodes on the edge
of the ground,
it does not penetrate it.
This is the J-DAM technology.
Exactly,
it explodes to expand
Its fragments
horizontally.
So you do not see big holes.
Exactly. 
And they used this narrative
to prove that this is not...
Yes, but the narrative claiming that 
this is a Palestinian missile
and there was a misfire
or an early explosion.
It depends on the idea that this is a missile
Where most of the
killings occurred because
of the fuel of the missile.
But there was no smell of fuel,
there was no...
There weren’t injures who had burns, 
They were all torn apart.
In addition to that, 
When you see the series 
of targeting crimes
against the health sector,
it is a natural part of
the systematic targeting of the health sector.
So it is part of a bigger picture.
Exactly.
Ok, about the other weapons
that were used, not on that day only,
But the other weapons that were used in general,
Like the white phosphorus,
I want to talk about it and I want to know
why it is important to talk about it from your point of view, doctor.
The white phosphorus,
the first time I treated a wound
with white phosphorus was in the war of 2008-2009
and it was used in a
wide way.
The first
wound was a 13-year-old
child in this war.
He and his family
were fleeing from
an area called
Al-Karama project, which are
residential buildings in northern Gaza
and they were targeted
with phosphorus bombs.
The phosphorus bombs
explode in the air
and act like a
shade of phosphorus blocks
and this
falls on people
because it is a chemical substance
that continues to burn
until
it reaches
a region in the body
where oxygen is cut off.
So they keep burning
in a way
like a drill
to the middle of the body
until it reaches
the bones
or the internal organs
and then it stops.
When you come and remove the fire,
if there is anything left of it,
it starts again.
So,
when you see it once in your life,
you do not make a mistake
in
identifying it.
And they used it. 
They used it, then they used it
another time 
when they targeted
the beach camp. Then they used it
in the south
several times.
Doctor,
on October 18,
the first bombing of a bakery
in the Gaza Strip happened,
in the camp of Al-Nusayrat
and the flour crisis began.
I am talking about the food crisis,
but I would like to understand
as a doctor, you have dimensions of 
medical, political, social
and other aspects as a Gazan. 
When you talk about the targeting of social, religious
and neighborhood sites,
the cultural heritage of the city,
mosques, churches, libraries, bakeries, markets,
what is the impact of targeting these sites
or the goal of targeting these sites
by the Israelis?
there is
one of the
most important academics
named Patrick Wolfe
who started
comparative
colonial studies.
He used to say
that the logic
that connects the relationship
between the colonizer
and the indigenous people
is the logic of cancellation.
He says
or he defines cancellation
as cancellation
that includes genocide
but is not content with it.
Patrick Wolfe
cancellation as physical genocide
but also
spiritual and historical genocide.
The logic of cancellation
wants to
remove the
Palestinian physically
and wants to remove
the Palestinian memory
and his relation to the land.
Like the Amalek.
Exactly.
When he says that
killing them, killing their children
and killing
their livestock
and burning the land in which they are
so that they do not have any memory left.
And you witnessed this.
The question is why
do you
invest all this money
in targeting
a tiny location
in the camp of 
Alburaij, which was discovered
by a Byzantine priest in Gaza?
What is the goal?
But this is the logic
that governs the relationship
between the colonizer
and the
indigenous people.
He wants to remove you physically
and also your memory.
He wants to erase your history
and your relation to this land.
A part of it becomes
To false the reality
And the other
part is creating a new narrative.
To attack your tracs wherever you are.
On October 19th and 20th
on the 13th and 14th day of the battle,
four hospitals
announced
that they stopped functioning, on the 13th,
And on the 14th another 7 hospitals have announced
Themselves being out of service, and out of fuel too.
We reached
more than 12,000
wounded
at that time.
Now, when we talk about
the idea of the increase of injuries,
and a decline of medical facilities
and the wounds and bacteria spreading,
how did you deal
with the wounds, and with the bacteria
at the beginning of this matter?
The problem
of the wounds of wars
is that there is
a high degree of pollution
because
all the soil
and all
What is around the wound
is entering 
like fragments
towards the wound.
So any wound,
especially
the wound of wars,
if it is not cleaned surgically I mean
not only by cleaning it from the outer part,
by removing
the soil,
the dirt and the
stones in it,
It will be subject to inflammation during the coming days.
When there are
thousands of injured people,
you are not able to take them all
to the operating room
So wounds remain
in this degree
of pollution.
This pollution
turns into bacterial inflammation.
When you have
thousands of injuries,
the first thing you run out of 
Are the disinfectants
because you want to try
to clean the wound.
Right.
The first thing
Which we run out of 
is chlorhexidine,
which is a wound disinfectant.
You can't make it in hospitals?
You can't make it in hospitals,
because
because of my previous
experience,
I had to go
to the shop
around the hospital.
I bought
all the vinegar
that they have.
Vinegar for salad.
Vinegar for consumption.
I saw it yes.
Yes.
And
I made
a strange mixture of
vinegar, a third of vinegar,
a third of dish soap,
and a third of water
to clean the wound.
I can tell you
that from the beginning of the week
until the end of the war,
until the last day before I took a taxi to rafah crossing,
I was cleaning the wounds of an injured 
in the same way, because we ran out of disinfectants.
But at the same time doctor,
you posted on Twitter 
or X oftenly,
on a daily basis.
Why was it important for you to post these things, 
Because some will say that 
you’re amid 
a war and posting?
Why was it important
for you to share the events
from your point of view in this way?
Did you feel that there was a good interaction?
No, I was detached from the outside world.
I mean, even in many days,
I was writing tweets and I knew
that there was no internet and I didn't know when
the internet would come back but I still wrote it.
Now, part of this was for documentation.
Part of it was
for the feeling that you,
despite your isolation, belong to
an outside world that may hear your voice
when you shout.
The main part,
for me,
and I still have a firm conviction especially
when I left Gaza,
that one of my duties
as a doctor
is to be a witness
to the crimes
committed
against my patients.
My duty
towards my patient
is to defend his rights.
His right
to treatment
and his right
to justice.
So, the main part
of these two rights
is to be a witness
to the tragedy
that you’re living.
I don't want to burden you with this, but our responsibility
is to take these details from you today,
so when I remind you of this please bear with me.
At this point,
we want to talk about
you being inside the hospital.
There was an increase
in the number of wounded
and a decline in medical facilities.
When you reached the stage
of standard operating procedures,
which are known
in the hospital.
Now, you are in a state of war.
I want you to tell me
the difference between the state of war
in the organization of high-quality work
in the hospital
and outside the war.
How were you able to organize
yourselves?
I was connected
to the team of
cosmectic surgery
through a good friendship
and trust,
And with Dr. Ahmed Mkhallalati,
who is the head of the department.
a relationship of friendship and understanding.
Every day,
the team,
almost every day,
as the cosmetic surgery department,
we had about 100 to 150 patients
after the first week.
100 to 150 patients
need surgeries.
Yes.
If you
performed your surgeries
and you had a the nursing and anesthesia services available,
Then with the best of 
possibilities, you could do
between 10 and 12 surgeries per day.
So, the daily Procedure of prioritization 
Of the surgeries
for the 150 wounded
to decide
who will go to the surgery,
It was a difficult procedure,
and it became more difficult
as the physical capacity of the place declined,
And then totally collapsed when we moved
From al-shifa to al-ahly hospital,
where there were only two operating rooms.
So, everyday
there was a meeting.
We used to
have a meeting at 8 o'clock
to decide who will go to the surgery.
From 10 to 12 people
And based on what data and principle.
In the beginning, the priority
was
based on
the principle of
saving the limbs.
In al-ahly hospital,
when were disconnected from the others
And were only two surgeons and two operating rooms
and hundreds of injuries,
it was based only on saving the people.
So, we moved from limb saving
to purely life saving.
And this makes you feel
like you are
in quicksand.
Every day, you feel like you are drowning more.
You are not able to make decisions
based on logic
Because you are barely
able to understand
a small part of
the disaster that is happening in front of you.
On the 15th of the battle, we reached
4,385 martyrs
and 13,561 wounded.
Here,
the occupation allowed
20 truckloads of aid.
To compare,
before the siege on 7th of October,
almost 500 trucks entered everyday,
Here, on that day,
they allowed 20 trucks.
This is 30% of the health and
humanitarian needs.
However, it was discovered
by the people of Gaza that
these trucks contain
Only shrouds for the martyrs and tests of the Corona virus.
These trucks, we heared about them and read about them too.
But I want to know what you witnessed about this,
Do you remember this part?
When the trucks entered,
What did they contain? did you receive any medical aid?
No.
No material
was sent to the north of the Gaza strip.
No material
was sent in sufficient quantities
to cause the slightest change
in the work of
the medical staff.
The number
was negligible.
The health sector and the Ministry of Health
did not have the ability
to participate
in deciding which 
Material should be sent
in the aid trucks.
The aid trucks 
did not change
anything in our lives.
Most of the time,
we did not even pay attention to it.
It is said that there are operations
to kidnap Palestinian bodies
by the Zionists
and the Israelis
to steal their organs 
and rip off
their skin. Is this true?
Yes,
there is still
An ongoing process of organ theft.
In my opinion,
These bodies were already decomposed.
So the use of them
for
living medical reasons
does not exist. However,
we know that Israel
relies on its wars in Gaza
to develop
its weapons
and to develop
the weapons
made by the Israeli occupation,
For the weapon industry.
We know
from the R&D cycle,
(research and development)
in weapons
that part of
the research and development of any weapon
is the analysis of the bodies
that were exposed to this weapon.
So when
you are
in the lab
testing a weapon
and reading the research
published on this weapon,
there is a part of it, the post-mortem
report of the weapon.
In my opinion,
what we are seeing is a part of
the cycle
of research
and development
of the used weapons.
So, Palestine is a lab?
Yes, not only a lab.
The second part
This is not something
that we claim.
the
advertisements
made by Israeli
weapons companies.
The materials used
to promote
Israeli weapons
rely on the phrase
“battle-tested”
So they increase their credibility.
Exactly.
And some
Israeli CEO’s  of
weapon companies
say that
What distinguishes them from others is that
They are 10 minutes
away from their lab.
When they talk about the Gaza Strip,
they say that it is close to their lab.
That is why their weapons
are more advanced
than the weapons
of any country that does not have
a lab like the Gaza Strip.
on the 17th day of
the war,
a threat began to hit the lives of 120
newborns due to the shortage of fuel
and the possibility of the shut down of medical equipment.
I would like to talk
about the children
in general and women.
Before the war,
there were children
with chronic diseases
and women as well
There were pregnant women
and the medical care
that women needed in general was interrupted by the war.
People could not
stop giving birth
And decide to gov birth after the war.
How did you deal with these cases?
The newborns story
is separate we’ll talk about it. 
First,
the systematic destruction
of hospitals
is not only about
To attack the injured people.
The goal is to turn
any chronic disease
into a deadly disease.
When you targeted
the Rantesi Hospital
and Muhammad Al-Durra
and Al-Nasr within a week,
you removed the children's medical sector
from Gaza.
Entirely? Entirely.
Any child who had diabetes,
any child who had asthma,
any child who had epilepsy,
any child who had
a complicated disease
that needs specialization
for treatment,
you turned this disease
from a chronic disease
into a deadly disease.
And we witnessed this 
In Al-Ahly Hospital when in its last stages it
became the only hospital in Gaza,
There were children coming with diabetes
because there was no insulin
and there was no medical capacity.
So,
the same thing
happened with kidney dialysis,
heart diseases 
and cancer.
The Maternity ward
in Al-Shifa Hospital was targeted.
Then, when they were transferred
to a nearby hospital,
Al-Hilo Hospital, it was also targeted
then there was a small hospital
for children called Al-Sahabi Hospital
that was targeted too.
At some point,
we found ourselves
An orthopedic surgeon and I
in Al-Ahly Hospital,
We were accompanied by
a general surgeon
and a 19-year-old
pregnant girl.
According to our reading,
The fragment entered her womb.
The general surgeon
was afraid
that if he went alone
without a 
A specialist in obstetrics and gynecology,
He was afraid
that he would have to remove her uterus
to save her from the bleeding.
So,
Allah blessed us
and showed mercy to her.
Because of the calls,
we found one of the doctors
who was in Al-Shifa Hospital and evacuated,
He was a specialist
in obstetrics and gynecology
Both of them
performed the surgery on this woman.
The fetus was martyred
Because the fragment reached the fetus,
However,
we were able to save
this 19-year-old girl.
However,
every few days,
we were able to perform
a caesarean operation
in Al-Ahly at the last stage
to reduce the pressure
on the pregnant women.
However,
due to the targeting of Al-Ahly Hospital,
we were unable to rehabilitate
the maternity ward
because it was in the upper floors
and the missile targeted it
Because when it hit the hospital
and damaged the elevator.
It was difficult to use the elevator
or impossible to use the elevator.
So,
there were
three stages.
The first stage was
to kill the wounded
and to kill
the chronic diseases.
And to create 
an environmental disaster
that led to the spread of epidemics
or to kill the survivors
through the spread of epidemics.
The machine of the
Israeli Hellfire War
used to kill people
in three stages.
We've now reached
In the 19th day to 2,704 children
who were martyred
from 6,546 martyrs.
Almost half of them
The only excavator in northern Gaza
stopped working because of the fuel shortage.
This excavator is used by the civil defense
in the rescue operations.
The number of the missing
is more than 1,600
including 900 children.
The Ministry of Health
published the records of the martyrs
of 7,028 martyrs.
Their full names,
age, and date of their martyrdom.
Only 281 of them
were unidentified martyrs.
I would like to talk about
how to identify the martyrs
and especially about the idea
that you mentioned during the war
which is the WCNSF
Wounded Child with No Surviving Family.
A wounded child without a family
for the rest of his life.
I would like to talk about
how did you identify the martyrs
and the wounded?
How did you identify them?
The martyrs
are identified
through relatives
who identify the bodies
and register
the identity of the wounded
and take
the death certificate.
With the development
of the war
and the increase
of the war severity,
two things happened.
The bodies
are buried in the building that was bombed
Because they were not able to 
take the dead bodies out.
The number of missing people under the rubble
was increasing
which is now more than 10,000.
When you pass in front of
a targeted building
after the second week,
you can smell
the decomposed bodies
you can smell it
While you are in the ambulance.
You could smell it doctor?
When I went back to Al-Shifa hospital,
I remember several buildings
which had the smell
of death.
This is the first part.
The second part
is when you use a bomb
of 2,000 pounds
which is more than 1,500 kg
or 1,000 kg
which is more than a ton.
Many of the bodies
evaporate.
They disintegrate
into non-existent parts
which are not able to be identified.
This is the second part
of the unidentified bodies.
Then,
in Gaza,
many of the neighbourhoods
Are organized socially
Which means
the large families
Live in the same neighborhood.
What happens in this war
is that Israel does not
target a building but a whole neighborhood
which is destroyed
with 6 or 7 bombs
of 2,000 pounds.
So there is a part of
the martyrs
Whose death was not reported
because no one was left from them
To report their death.
The current
number of
the martyrs in my opinion,
represents
60% of the total number
of the martyrs.
The phenomenon of the children
who were injured
and who were
displaced from under the rubble
and who did not have any relatives
even from the 2nd and 3rd level
they were seen
in al-shifa hospital
from the beginning of the war.
I remember a child
who I performed a surgery on,
Her mother was a colleague
At Al-shifa hospital.
and she martyred and passed away
with the rest of the family.
This 9-year-old girl was left
And was seen with other children
in the emergency room
alone
with no one
around them.
When al-shifa hospital
was besieged, there were
more than 120 children.
We do not even know
their first names because of how small they were. 
I remember
I performed a surgery in al-ahli hospital
on a 3-year-old boy
whose leg and hand were amputated.
We did not know his name.
The Palestinian organizations
of Orphans
in Gaza
say
that there are
about 25,000 orphans
in the Gaza Strip
because of the war.
When you saw the children
Beside being a doctor, 
as Palestinian
A father,a Gazan,
when you saw
the children
in this way
and in this quantity, 
and when they look at you
and wait for you to
treat them, what do you think about?
So my whole life developed 
Because of the wars, 
But there is a 
specific point 
of my life,
There is a specific point
when you become a father.
Your ability to
interact with the children
who are injured
changes a lot
when you have
children because you see the faces
your children in all these children.
The strange
thing is that people always
when they ask you, they think
that it is the part related to injuries
and injuries and distortions
and blood and flesh and this
that breaks
your heart
and still after 30 years
unable to deal
with it. It is
moments when you see
the image
of the child or what he was
before the injury.
When you see
the braid of the small girl injured
in her face.
When you see the bruise
When you see
the nail polish 
that they put before,
when you see
the boy
and you talk to him
about the football
or his team. These
things that are painful
for me
more than the injuries
and the brokenness
because it takes you back to
a moment, to a basic point
that this is a child.
And this is not his place 
On this planet
To be here 
at this moment
injured in this
ugly way
affected by these big
distorted injuries that will change
his life and the rest of his life.
On the 
21st day of the battle
October 27th
at 7 o'clock
that day, the connection
with Gaza was completely cut off.
We were in Kuwait
and we were
seeing on social media
that there was no connection with Gaza
and there was no electricity in Gaza.
And on that night
there was the worst and most crucial operation
of shooting and
slaughtering throughout these 20 days.
This
caused a kind of
in social media
we felt something
we felt that even
this bombing reached the social media
we felt this thing. So how will it be if you are
inside this Strip.
Was this the most violent day when you were inside?
It was
not only the most violent day
I remember at the beginning of the day
There was a press conference
for the Israeli army
he was showing pictures of the trenches
and tunnels under the ground of al-shifa hospital. 
The Israeli started the psychological war
in preparation for the
Narrative that says the al-shifa hospital was a military base
and that it was the control center
of Hamas
and that it should be targeted.
Then after
the press conference
all the communications were cut off and then
the violent bombing started.
The bombing
shook the whole room
and for me personally
I remember that night
very clearly.
I was in the operation room
and I sat
and there was
you know like a 
Reconciliation in some way, 
an internal reconciliation in me
with the idea that
I will probably not
get out of this war.
I mean
I reached a conviction
at that time that
all the choices I took
in my life
and all the path I took
in my life reached me to a point
that I am proud of
but
everything in the world has a price
and the price of this
life that I chose
that I will not get out of
this war.
And it was strange
because it was
a moment
as I told you
the reconciliation
but after that
there was like a
relief that I in some way,
When I opened a door and entered
from my room to another room
I was comfortable
with the bombing. I mean I stopped
Feeling 
The danger
with every explosion
because I reconciled with the idea
that
this is the person
his destiny
or his fate
and that's it
you have to try
to complete
this journey
even if it ended
with
your death.
Now, this idea had
positive
implications as I told you
that one stops feeling terrified with every bombing
and becomes comfortable
and more capable
to work
but there is another part
related to children.
So let me 
give you an example, that night,
even though
there was no
internet
and even in the remaining days
when there was no internet
I was deliberately
sending a voice message
to the children
to each one of them
every day.
Voice message?
I mean I didn’t say sad things
but
on the contrary
I try to be
positive and
have a strong voice
but I had a feeling
that I wanted
them to hear my voice
till the last moment. What were you saying to them?
I miss you
I love you
And about your family doctor, 
in the beginning there were threats to your family
you were in
Gaza
and you even wrote that
your family have faced enough
Deviation and threats.
May God be with you
So regarding this idea, 
This is also a threat to you
In the first place
not only to your family.
Your family was in Britain
in a safe area,
what did you mean when you said
that your family had enough threats and extortion?
It was on many levels
first of all, 
The counter terrorism police
at 8 am came to my wife
in the house
and interrogated her for an hour
why did he leave?
who paid  for his tickets?
is he related to any association?
Where? in which hospital?
On which floor at al-shifa?
I mean there were
provocative questions
the goal of which..
because at that time
I was getting
on a lot of news platforms
every occasion
my twitter account
every tweet
there were
hundreds of thousands of views
so it happened
they wanted intimidate me
So that I stay silent,
since you were there at least you should stay silent
because don't forget that you have
a family outside
and we can reach them.
the second part
is the Zionist
and rightist newspapers
started
to create stories
and articles
that are related to
Hamas,
The resistance movement, 
And the threats,
so there was
an attempt to silence people
since the beginning
of the war
my decision was that
The problem of these bats of darkness
Can’t be solved, the only solution
For them was light.
so the day
I found out from my wife
that the police came to our house, 
I had an interview with the BBC
in a daily political program
a news program
called “News Night”
so that day when the host was asking me
I told her what happened. 
“news night” is one of the biggest news programs.
So what happened,
in my opinion,
the police didn't expect
to release this information
on the media
so quickly
so there was a retreat.
the second part
that they rely on,
Is that when
You have 
no
financial ability
for
a team of lawyers
To threaten them to sue
these newspapers
so I contacted
Tayeb Ali
who is a human rights lawyer
in London
and I asked him to sue the police
and sue any newspaper
that tries
to
publish articles
against me
so this was the second part
that silenced them.
So what happened
is that the BBC stopped
contacting me
since they couldn’t 
silence me
there was an internal decision
that I shouldn't appear on the media.
Also, there was a radio
Radio 4
there was a morning program
where I was asked to
send a voice message
every few days
to tell them about the daily lives of a British
Surgeon during the war.
all of a sudden one time
they stopped contacting me.
so when
Causing fear to us doesn't work
there is a next step
which is silencing us.
hmm
So Doctor
this was a target that took place
a target at you
in a way or another.
During the war
there were more than 300 martyrs
from the medical team
and there was a target at the medical team
was this target
in a direct way?
was there a sniper?
I heard they were waiting for them
to get home
and they were targeted
didn't you feel that they were targeting you
personally?
hmm
the target
for the medical team
was systematic
and well-studied
when you target someone like
Dr. Hammam Al-Loh
who is the only consultant
for
Kidney diseases in Gaza
or
Dr. Hani Al-Haytham
the head of the emergency department
you target
15 years
of education and training
the hospital is rebuilt
in a year or two
a consultant with this
level of experience
and knowledge
takes a whole generation
to be able to train him.
I didn't realize
the target
in the heat
of the battle
I realized it
when I tried to leave Gaza
and the Israelis refused
to let me leave Gaza
and it took several days
to be able to leave
then I realized
if there was a target list
there is a possibility
that my name is on this list.
on the 29th day
of the battle,
on the 4th of November
the occupation was killing
a child and injuring two other children 
every 10 minutes
the number of hospitals that became out of service
was increased to 16 hospitals,
the number of martyrs 
in the medical staff 
was 137,
even their snipers
had shot by Dr. Mohamed Abed
but he didn't die.
How did this affect
each other
you were colleagues
you worked together
and there were moments
when you were trying
to save people
the moments between you
weren't normal
they were very deep.
How did you deal
with this as a team
when you heard someone was martyred
or targeted?
I remember
we were in the hospital
and the sister of of our colleague 
Dr. Midhat Saidam (may he rest in peace)
Had arrived at the hospital
she has
evacuated from her house
because it was targeted
Dr. Medhat said
I will take her home
all my family is at home
and I will come back
since the situation was under control,
and we were all there.
When Dr. Medhat didn’t come back
we thought
he was tired
he was with us for 4-5 days
he decided to stay
with his family maybe,
and the next day we found out
that the building was targeted
where his family was
and his brother and sister
and their children were martyred
and Dr. Medhat too. 
I worked with him
from the war of 2009
to the war of 2014
and we worked on many projects
there were colleagues
in the Burns unit in the hospital 
they have known him for 20-25 years
and this shows
the patience
and the will
of the medical team
in the Gaza Strip.
I remember
everyone cried
for this person
who must be mourned
and then
when we finished
we went back to work
and it was done.
These doctors
and I am one of them
I always told them
that I am lucky that my children are not with me,
all these medical teams
were doing their job
and they didn't know
if their children were martyred
and if the house
where that is being targeted
is their house or their relatives.
So during our presence,
the brother of one of colleagues 
was martyred, 
the cousins of another doctor
were martyred
and this is only in the cosmetic surgery department.
And didn’t you find yourself one day
Breaking down?
Where you stopped for a second and 
Felt like 
that I had 
that burnout?
because
it is normal to feel this way in that situation 
I mean.
One day the Israelis
targeted a mosque
in the neighborhood of Sabra
50 martyrs
came and hundreds
of wounded
and we were alone
and
only
two operating rooms
and hundreds of wounded
and you don't know who to take
and who to prioritize
at that time.
I remember
that I felt
that what a person is doing is useless
because he is not able
to treat someone
and you are choosing to do surgeries
for a small percentage
of the wounded
at that time
a person is hit
with a deep feeling
of helplessness.
And I remember
that all the operating room
and the team was
depressed
and
the Doctor of  
Gynecological diseases
brought
a patient who had to undergo a
caesarean operation
and I remember the first time
we heard the voice of a baby
born in the operating room
it is the only thing
that brought us out of this
Depression, when you hear
the voice of the life of a baby for the first time
after more than
a month of death.
Because
the depression was not something
easy, especially when you 
Always try
to be especially
after
this experience
to be motivating
especially for the doctors
Whom this was their first war,
so
it should not be you who they see
getting weaker
so this role was required from you
because there are a young doctors,
so it was required
that you are always smiling
and you are always encouraging
and you are always motivating
and you try to contain
the one who was stressed and to
Understand them.
Managing others
in this difficult situation
was an essential part of your work
as a senior surgeon
November 6th was a
very special day
a very important day
because Israel in that day
committed the biggest massacre in hours
since its establishment in 1948
1500
martyrs and wounded
5 hospitals were bombed
including children , hospitals which had cancer patients,
psychological health issues
including thousands of sick
wounded and displaced.
you as a Doctors here
I expect that the extermination of hospitals
has already exceeded
your expectations
you know that there is an official operation
to exterminate hospitals
but I want to talk about
the role of international organizations
and there is an accusation
against this role of international organizations
there is an accusation
of colluding with the Zionist entity
in one way or another, it shouldn’t be in a direct way, 
but you are a part
of this scene
and you have dealt with them
to what extent is this true?
I am
convinced that
international organizations
work under
the roof of the Israeli will and authority
because they realize
as individuals
and as institutions
that there is
a complete western political
cover for Israel
so these organizations have to
coexist with the Israeli will
and work under its roof
instead of
working under the roof
of international law
or the needs
or
the declared goal
of these organizations
whether it is the International Health Organization
or the Red Cross or UNRWA
so they are
under the roof of
the Israeli will
without trying to challenge
the Israeli will
at the same time
One of the
American authors
of African origins
that I love
Audrey Lord
she wrote once
that “the tools of the master
will not destroy the master's house”
and all of these are the tools of the master
the white master
the western master
the American master
so the question
we have to ask is
why don't we have the tools?
why don't we have the Red Cross?
or the Arab Red Crescent?
or the Islamic Red Crescent?
we don't have that.
We don’t have 
the Arab Health Organization
or the Islamic Health Organization
why don't we have
these tools?
the tools of soft power
which are
an expression
of a political will
Using these tools,
which its Agenda
Is and Agenda 
that represents us,
not the agenda of others
and their vision of us
and our needs
and our circumstances.
Do you feel that there is an orientalist view of us
or do you feel that they don’t understand us?
no no
there is a colonialist view
in the end
when the beginning
of any discussion
with any western official
is
the Israeli view
or the Israeli propaganda
of the situation
you will be amazed.
Because he is seeing the exact 
Same thing which you are seeing,
but for him
despite the fact that Israel
is committing all these crimes
and atrocities
Israel can't lie
so when Israel
tells you that there is
Under al-shifa hospital 
Hamas bases
You will believe it.
when Israel tells you
that within half an hour
of the missile
that targeted the al-ahli hospital
that this missile is from the Islamic Jihad side
You will believe it without any discussion.
And when you talk to a manager
of a British NGO
there is a complete acceptance
of the idea that
there is a possibility of Hamas being there. 
so there is a kind of
indifference
with the western view
of the western Israeli
and that he is like him
and you are the “other”
so always
despite the crimes committed by Israel
he is still the reference
for these
groups and individuals
The Israelis have pride in that. 
exactly
On November 16
on the 41st day of the war
Maybe we skipped some things a bit
but there is a point
I mentioned this before,
there is an important incident
which is the day you stayed
At the Al-Ma’madani hospital, 
you didn't go to back the Al-Shifa,
and then
the hospital was occupied
Al-shifa hospital, and Al-rantisi hospital,
As well as the Indonesian hospital
why did you decide not to go back
to the Al-shifa hospital?
and how did the occupation
of the Al-shifa hospital 
affect you
and the health sector?
At the end stage,
The week before 
the occupation of the al-shifa hospital,
I started to go back to Al-ahli
to rehabilitate the operating rooms
in order to reduce the pressure on Al-shifa
I used to go every day
to operate in Al-ahly
and at the end of the day I go back to Al-shifa
and at the end of the night
I stay with my brothers at the burns unit
in al-shifa and the next morning
I go back to al-ahly
they targeted more than 100 ambulances
weren't you afraid of being hit
you know
one had the idea
that the targeting
will happen
whenever it happens
there is no absurdity
in targeting
when Israel decided to target you
it will target you
the second part is the huge pressure
on the number of injuries
was the main obstacle in one's thinking
so one day
I got in the ambulance
I wanted to go back to al-ahly from al-shifa hospital
because I promised one of the doctors
that I will operate on his son
who had been injured in his face,
we got in the ambulance
we saw a car
carrying Israeli soldiers
crossing the street
at the end of the street
And at that day al-shifa hospital came to its end.
Al-shifa had the capacity of 30% 
of the Palestinian health sector
And the managing of the ministry of health
Was managed 
From al-shifa hospital,
and the second important thing
is that al-shifa had in its surroundings 
a blood bank
which gives
blood bags to all hospitals
in the Gaza Strip
so when the alshifa hospital was sieged
not only did we lose 30% of the medical capacity
But even all the specializations
like nerve surgery
chest surgery
and intensive care
we also lost the blood bank
so we had to operate
on a patient
suffering from severe bleeding
which was difficult
and in some cases almost impossible to stop.
In some cases
we had to amputate some parts 
because we didn't have the ability
to replace his blood
so we had to operate on him quickly
to save his life.
so 100% this idea wasn’t arbitrary 
That al-shifa hospital
had military bases
so we have to go to the hospital.
The process of dismantling the health sector
in Gaza
and dismantling
any kind of
health assistance
which can greatly affect
so this is the idea.
We’ll go to the 16th of November
the 41st day of the war,
which is the day
of the collapse
of all the health systems
on this day
you doctor decided
to stop your operations
and leave the Gaza strip
how did you decide that
all the health systems collapsed
and you decided to leave?
we were doing operations
almost
Till 5 in the morning 
Then we stopped
and this began from 8 in the morning
the day before
we were doing continuous operations
for the wound
and at 5
the colleagues at the anesthesia unit told us
that all the anesthesia medicine
were used up
and that they don't have the ability
to perform any kind of medical anesthesia
and at that time
we realized
that your work as a surgeon
in al-ahly hospital
was impossible
the hospital was transformed
from a hospital to a
primary care center
for the wounded
without an operating room
so the decision was
to try to go to the south
to join the medical teams
in the south
maybe their situation will be better
and one can practice his work there
so
me
and one of the medical technicians
and a group of 3 or 4
From the nurses
and anesthesia specialists
who had families in the south,
we decided to
leave al-ahly hospital
to the south of Gaza
we left
because the Israelis
were placing a lot of
quadcopters
with sniper rifles
in an area around the hospital
and a lot of wounded people
were targeted by the Israelis
in this way
so we decided to
walk in the streets
and ask
the people around us
where are the tanks
where are the quadcopters
6 hours
of walking until we reached
the
central area of Gaza
which is in the south
of
the place
that the Israelis seperated
The north and south at.
in civilian clothes?
yes
and I left most of my clothes
and only my
handbag on my shoulder
because I knew that there was a long walk ahead of us
I reached a hospital
Al-awdeh hospital
it is a part of
a health institution
that has a hospital in al-Nusairat
called Al-Awdeh hospital
so when I reached
To al-nusairat I went to Al-Awdeh hospital
and joined them there
the first day
I slept most of the night
and then
I tried to
join some hospitals
or work with the hospital
in Nusairat
so
what happened
was that
I reached the conclusion
that the situation in the south
was not much better
there was a shortage of surgeons
because
of the shortage of resources
and the shortage of medicines
so the operating rooms
were working
with 40%
of their capacity
because of the shortage of resources
and I started to think
if as a doctor
I don't have
a goal of staying here
what am I doing?
And there is a feeling
that you don't want to leave your family right?
of course
your colleagues, friends
and the wounded
and the sick
at the same time you are stuck
you are watching
the tragedy around you
and you can't intervene
so you have to work abroad
but you transfer this effort
abroad to another place
this was the thought
if I can't be useful
in the end
my transition from Al-Awdeh to Al-Shifa
and from Al-Awdeh to Al-Shifa
and from Al-Shifa to Al-Ahly
and back to Al-Shifa and back to Al-Ahly
I always had an urge
to be useful
To be adding something good
because the situation is so bad
that they can't
handle the
lack of efficiency in the system
so I used to feel
who am I helping if I am sitting here?
right, doctor
how do you deal with it?
while I am talking to you
it is clear that
you are having some kind of shock
after what you saw,
I don't think it will go away
how do you deal with it?
how do you try to contain it?
how do you try to interact with it?
look
without a doubt
it is like
any physical injury
it takes time to heal
it is a psychological injury
like the physical injury
you have to, within yourself you
know that it happened,
so you can
recover from it.
when needed
if you need
help specialists
I had more than one session
with specialists
it is necessary
it is necessary, yes
but
my complete recovery
Isn’t possible now,
there is a feeling
because of the continuity of the tragedy
it is hard
the post-traumatic
there is no post-traumatic
we are still in the tragedy
in the trauma
sometimes you wake up
you watch the tragedy
in front of you
there is a deep feeling 
guilt
that you left
your friends
your colleagues
the patients
the tragic situation
sometimes you feel
that it was easier for you to stay.
Will you go back?
at any moment
I feel that
there are possibilities
to work again, yes. 
how can we think
about the reconstruction of Gaza
and why is it important to think of that today?
that we allocate
these feelings
and these ideas that we talked about 
during the disaster that exists.
how can we allocate it
in the right way
so that we don't change  it
in the way the Israeli occupation wants, 
how can we
rebuild Gaza?
what can we do from here?
if you accept that
the goal of this war
is to evacuate Gaza from its population
and as a part of
the continuation of the idea of
creating a land without a people
and to accept
that the Israelis always try
to achieve during the ceasefires what they didn't achieve duriing the war
and that the Israelis
who committed
What happened in this war
are the ones who turned Gaza
into a place that is not suitable for living
The moment 
of the ceasefire
Should be related to
a campaign of reconstruction
and rehabilitation
and treatment
of physical and mental injuries.
as much as the disaster
is big, the campaign must be big
to prevent
Israel from achieving
what they didn't achieve in the war
during the ceasefire
Do you think the world has become aware?
In my opinion
the world is aware
of the Israeli goals
In my opinion
the Arab world
should realize
that
this
Ghoul that
has reached its population
and all the parts of its population
to
a mental
Genocidal mindset
will not return
to the
To his state
if he wins the war in Gaza
and that it will go to
the West Bank and will expel
the people of the West Bank to Jordan
and will go to Lebanon and Syria
so this
genocidal mindset, 
the moment it becomes
dominated by
a population like the Israeli population
poses a threat
to all the peoples of the region
But the Palestinian cause is fair in itself
even if it poses a threat to
the region
to find a solution
and support it
even if it poses a threat
is what we should do
I think personally,
and this is the origin of the issue
Doctor, you are our family
you are our loved ones
and your presence in Kuwait is very dear to us
and your acceptance of the invitation is very dear to us
especially that you
were raised on this land
and as you are close to us
we will be close to you
I think I see the issue in a positive way
I think there is awareness
not only in the Arab world
but also from the decision makers
in general in the world
I think the good will be accepted
in Kuwait
and we must continue
hoping that God makes it easier
Thank you doctor for coming
Thank you
Thank you Munera
