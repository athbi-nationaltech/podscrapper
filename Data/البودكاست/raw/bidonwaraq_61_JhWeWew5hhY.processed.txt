80 percent or 90 percent of the content
circulating on social media
which is communicated and debated and
argued about
and which determines the issues of the
day
who creates it?
the news media. The newspapers
I mean I consider myself
a social media user
I'm like a double agent. I think we control
five percent of it
The content created on twitter
is less than five percent. The other 95
percent is created by the news media
So they determine for you what you're
talking about. What issue are you
discussing? It'll be
the issue the news media decided on and
which will be the talking point on social
media
Good evening or good morning,
depending on
when you're tuning in. Today our guest is
the veteran media personality, Ali
Al-Thafeeri
We tried as much as we could
in an hour and forty minutes to discuss his
long career
We spoke of his origins in Kuwait, then his
short move
to Saudi Arabia, followed by his time at Al
Jazeera
and we spoke about the media
media concepts. We talked about the
Arab Spring
during his time at Al Jazeera and issues he
cares about. It's a very interesting
discussion
And so, I hope you enjoy the episode. I'm
Faisal Al-Agel and this is Bidon Waraq
Today, Bu Salman
I was telling Munera that today we want
to do the interview and take a deep dive,
unscripted, with Ali Al-Dhaferi
You pulled it all together. The fact is I'm
very happy
to be on Bidon Waraq and I've been
following the show for a while, but this is
my first time
appearing on a podcast
And I said, if I'm to participate in one, it
would be this
Then I got the call from you and Munera
and I was very happy and it's a source of
pride for me
Truthfully, we're the ones who are proud
to have you join us today
And I'm surprised by how beautiful, easy
and simple the means are
without the complications of television
It's a beautiful mix between radio and
television
Bu Salman, you grew up in Jahra
and what I've understood is that Jahra is
very close to Bu Salman's heart
Yes
I'd like to start with your beginnings in
Jahra
and move to your career trajectory
but I'd like to start with Jahra and what
makes Jahra so special to you
and what you recall of your time growing
up there
The first thing is quite common
which is the love every person feels for
the city where they were born and grew
up. I think every city where a childhood is
spent
will be special to the person, and Jahra is
no different
But there's an interesting custom in
Kuwait where no other city is attributed to
a person
but Jahra, so we say, this person is Jahrawi
This doesn't exist for other cities. Jahra is
a wonderful
mixture representing not only Kuwait
but the entire region. Jahra has a bedouin
side and a settled side
There are tribes and those of Iraqi origins
and those originally from
Saudi Arabia and Kuwaiti origin, of course.
So there's a beautiful mix of people
In fact, I remember in my childhood, we
didn't know what people's origins were
We didn't know their families or tribes. We
only knew their names
The first name and the second. So there
was an equality there
and there was a range of accents and
cultures
but they were merged
And co-existing
Jahra has the sense of a village too
It has the dimension of the desert, of
course. It's at the edge of the desert
and it also has the village
which we didn't live in
It's agricultural, with water and wells. So
this was all beautiful. Jahra is a city that...
of course Kuwait is small
so Jahra isn't a border city, but it's far from
the center
And distant towns tend to be distinct
with something extraordinary, a kind of
suffering or struggle
And from this emerges creativity
Truthfully many prominent figures in the
cultural, literary
media and political scene came from
Jahra. And it gives
you a point of view, you know a lot about
this world through
a childhood in Jahra. It also has wonderful
education
and it's got fighting and thuggery and
fear
and other features which are
extraordinary and different
So all of this makes the city close to my
heart because it's my city
and it's where I still live and I plan to stay
there
until the end. So people have a natural
love
for their cities. And I wouldn't say mine is
excessive
for Jahra
but as I said it has special features and
qualities. Even its name
Jahra, has a special ring to it, Faisal. Even
when you say Jahrawi
people will
say that so-and-so is a Jahrawi
Actually
there are people who lived there and then
returned to Saudi Arabia or Iraq
or went to other cities, but Jahra always
brings them back together
If the name comes up, it really
sparks something. Truthfully, I've met
a lot of people who share a bond with the
city
and it's a bond I share with them as well
Great, so before you returned to your
country of Saudi Arabia, before the
invasion [of Kuwait]
specifically, what was the media like? I
know you would read
the Al-Qabas newspaper and you would
read
Ahmed Mattar and Muthaffar Al-Nawab
and you were also influenced by the
artwork of Naji Al-Ali. So I'd like to know
what the media was like at this time
Ok, well I was young
during the invasion, I was fifteen, so
before that at 13 or 14
I think the beginning of consciousness
happens at 13
so let's say in 1988
or eighty-seven. And the truth is, it
happened by accident
The Al-Qabas newspaper was the main
platform
and it was the newspaper of choice in our
house, mainly for reasons related
to sports. I mean, I was a Kathma fan
but others at home
like my brothers were reading for sports.
But there were pieces on
the front page, by Ahmed Mattar, which
were short, clear little poems
Like little capsules of meaning
And there were also drawings by Naji
Al-Ali, such as the famous Hanthala sketch
And so our consciousness and awareness
was aroused
concerning Palestine, the issues of the
Umma, our Arabness
about heroism and victory
And about defeat and our battles that
existed in that period, and our battle
the main one, of course, with the Zionist
enemy
and also the Iran-Iraq war
So it was in this atmosphere that I, as a
child, picked up Al-Qabas
to look at the pictures and read some
things
so this is where I formed a relationship
with Ahmed Mattar's work in particular
He's an Iraqi poet who lived a while in
Kuwait
and then left. And I think it was under
pressure of the Iraqi regime
at that time. He left a trace on me
and I think he left a trace on many of my
generation
He had a very big impact
Ahmad's poetry is simple and
straightforward
and there's not much complexity or
musicality. He writes
Be a hypocrite, be a hypocrite, and again
a thin body is not spared from harm
If you aren't a hypocrite, be one, for what
is hypocrisy
if you tell a lie when you're honest? Have
your principles and don't despair. Be firm
but in different spaces. Get ahead
of others
for wisdom is reserved for the lords of
precedent
At that time, such sarcasm, this direct
attack affected us, of course
and led to further developments
So in terms of media in Kuwait, there was
Kuwait Television, the main station
but we were only watching
football games, cartoons and kids' shows
as well as the odd play
I didn't connect much to the theater
before the invasion
but in later phases and following the
liberation of Kuwait
we became more aware of plays and
began following the theater
But the Al-Qabas newspaper
was the national, Arab, professional
platform
It was one of the most important
newspapers in the Arab world
Later, working at Al Jazeera, I discovered
the huge impact Al-Qabas had
as well as the eminent journalist,
Mohammed Al-Sager
I'm speaking of the Editor in Chief,
Mohammed Al-Sager
an exceptional man who was able to
create
an important press experience in the
Al-Qabas newspaper
and then in the Jarida newspaper. Far
from his work as a trader and a
businessman
or a politician, but as a journalist, he's
exceptional
and rare
and he has a clear national commitment
that was reflected in the newspaper
and its activities and the big names that
wrote for Al-Qabas
So this is a somewhat limited overview of
the media scene
and this all evolved after the Iraqi invasion
as well
One is older and able to read more and
acquire more books and learn
Now, Muthaffar Al-Nawab, specifically
I read your book "Between Al Jazeera and
the Revolution" and you frequently
refer to Muthaffar Al-Nawab and
you have a picture with him when you
met in Damascus, so he obviously
had a big influence on you, culturally
and helped shape your ideas, so
what draws you to Muthaffar Al-Nawab?
Muthaffar Al-Nawab is the poet of
revolution, of rage
of political profanity. His famous poem --
Al-Quds is the Bride of your Arabness
and so on. It might be inappropriate to
recite it
I've memorized a good portion of his
poetry
In addition to the condition that arose
within us, Faisal
Muthaffar was incredibly important, and
the cassette tapes of his recitations were
influential
and they used to come to us
illegally in various ways
The truth is that when I encountered the
first poem by Muthaffar
from that moment, this relationship and
strong association formed
They say
and I'm not sure of the accuracy of the
saying
It's strange to not be a communist before
the age of twenty
and it's strange to be a communist past
twenty
So the revolutionary condition
is similar to a state of adolescence
17, 18 years old, and it's a state connected
to anger
and knowledge too. And the truth is
that anger and a revolutionary spirit may
be directed towards behavioral areas
like drug problems. and gangs, but these
feelings can also be directed down
cultural and knowledge paths
like it did with me and with others
A lot of this adolescent anger is also
associated with
the general breakdown in the Arab world
that we've been experiencing
The invasion of Kuwait was a big fracture
Very big. Not just for us in Kuwait. It was a
fracture of the Arab nation
This regime that people had supported
and defended
and mobilized support for in the face of
Iran
He turned against us overnight
so we were all broken by it. And honestly
Kuwait doesn't deserve such treatment
at all
Kuwait has stood firm in the Palestinian
cause. It has large-scale
projects across the Arab states that can't
be counted
Even rich countries, like the Emirates,
their education systems were set up
by Kuwait, with Kuwaiti curricula and
support. In Yemen
universities and hospitals. Schools in
Sudan, etc
And Kuwait was a cultural axis of Arab
thought and periodicals
All of this and politicians also supported
the Umma
such as the positions of Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah, may God have mercy on him
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad. From Abdullah
Al-Salem and onwards
they held strong positions on the Umma
and its issues
So imagine that Kuwait is rewarded with
this terrible crime?
to be invaded on the 2nd of August [1990]
So this brought a state of disintegration
and the stance of the Palestinian
Authority
also did a great deal of damage
concerning the Palestinian question and
the situation of Palestinians
whether in Kuwait or elsewhere
So these issues were boiling in us. Anger,
hope, love for Palestine
heartbreak
a classical sort of admiration for [Gamal]
Abdel Nasser. I mean, Abdel Nasser is the
most prominent Arab despot
and the one who really developed
the tyranny system in the Arab world, but
we used to love him
We thought he was honest
We thought he had a vision
We thought, we considered tyranny to be
a typical feature of the time, in the 1950s
and so on
Ultimately, he made a negative political
deviation
but we had admiration for him at some
point
Even now, some people are kind to his
memory
As for Saddam Hussein, some people
bemoan his departure without knowing
what he did
We were affected. Yes, in the moment
by what occurred in Iraq in 2003
the way in which he was executed, the
timing and the sectarian issues... we were
all affected
And I think it affected a wide range of the
Umma
but we always have to remember what
he had done before, to the Iraqi people,
first, then to Kuwait
and then to the Arab Umma. What
Saddam Hussein's regime
did on the 2nd of August was the final nail
in the coffin of our Arabness
and the idea of the Arab nation and the
associations
that bind us
So all of this led me to Muthaffar and I was
trying to meet him in
Damascus where he was living
I went to Damascus for the first time in '94
or '95, I don't remember
It didn't happen then. They told me he
was in Rawdha
and finally we met him in Havana cafe,
where we took this picture
I've tweeted about it
and what's strange, Faisal, about these
tweets
which were critical, of course
Firstly, I spoke positively of him and how I
respected
his state of sentimentality, sadness,
sorrow, exile, and great Baghdad
Iraq and the Umma and Palestine, but I'm
not a fan
of his political poetry, personally
So at that first meeting I asked a few
questions, three questions
and when I wrote about it, some people
said
you like this man who disparages the Gulf.
What they don't know is that
in '95 I was criticizing him for what he said
about the Gulf
when those people hadn't even learned to
read yet
and other people, revolutionaries, were
like
You, a Khaleeji, who are you to criticize
Muthaffar?
this great man, so there was some back
and forth on that needs clearing up
Great, so following the breakdown, let's
say, of the Arab idea
It didn't break. For me, I think it's been
shaken
But there's a lack of unity between states?
In terms of the Arab world? Yes, absolutely
So, we're saying that following this period
and you were affected by the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait
did it change your idea of Arabism and the
Arab project?
I'm someone who faces two struggles. In
the case of the Gulf, I've always tried to
defend
Arabism and say that we have a real bond,
and we can't remove ourselves from the
body of the Umma
And in the wider Arab region, I defend
the Gulf because the fact is that
there's an orderly and systematic program
to malign the Gulf across the Arab world
This is practised by
cultural institutions, by political
institutions and media institutions
and I'll tell you what I said to Muthaffar
Al-Nawab. It's important for some people
to hear it. In '95
Of course, I'm in awe of him, but I said, Bu
Adel
I asked him
first about Ahmad Mattar because I
admire him, so I wondered what
his opinion of him was
He thought that the poetry's content was
lovely, but
that it lacked musicality
I then asked, when it comes to the Gulf
Why are King Fahad, May God have mercy
on him, or Sultan Qaboos, May God have
mercy on him, mentioned negatively?
Why are the symbols of the Gulf referred
to harshly and cruelly?
and are always linked to colonialism and
imperialism?
Why is the Gulf always pictured in this
highly negative manner?
And then when it comes to Hafez
Al-Assad, and this despotic, sectarian
regime
which is backwards and this man who
committed
the most heinous massacres in that
country from 1970 to today
it continues to the present day
Or you look at Gaddafi, this man, God's
mercy on all of them, this man who had
the weakest mind, who lacked
moderation and understanding
and this man who wasted and destroyed
Libya's wealth
Libya is an oil rich country, similar to the
Gulf
And when it comes to Iraq and its
despotic regime, headed by Saddam
Hussein, he's not mentioned by name
These countries or regimes are not
patterned in certain ways
except for occasional references, but
when it comes to the Gulf
Saudi Arabia, Oman
the rest of the Gulf states are mentioned
negatively
So, there was some debate, and honestly, I
wasn't very balanced
I was a young guy and Muthaffar is a big
name. So he explained his thinking
but the conversation revealed my
position, which is
I consider Saudi Arabia to be
the most progressive country in the Arab
world, along with Qatar, Kuwait
the Emirates, Oman, and Bahrain
How?
As compared to cities like Damascus
Baghdad and even Egypt for a period of
time
All these systems, all our Arab states, have
been blessed with wealth. Some are rich
in
oil such as the Gulf, Iraq, Libya, and Algeria
Others are rich in other sources, such as
water and agriculture
important sectors
What have these three states, with all due
respect, Libya, Algeria, and Iraq done with
their wealth?
for their people? What have these
countries achieved, in terms of
development
and progress and education? What
conditions do their people live in?
Over 50% are in the diaspora or in exile.
Look at the conditions of those states
Iraq has been completely destroyed
Libya has been destroyed, thanks to the
Qaddafi regime
not because of the revolution
just so we're precise about this. Iraq has
been destroyed
yes, by the U.S. invasion
in 2003, but before that, by the regime
Syria, what has Syria done from 1970 to
today?
Syria also has resources. Not oil, but other
sources of wealth. All have been
destroyed
But if you look at the Gulf states, and this
is not personal bias
I love Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the Emirates
and Kuwait like I love Algeria
Libya and Egypt, the Sudan
Mauritania and Iraq. Definitely, my sense
of belonging to the Gulf is deeper, but
I love the region in general
What's the condition of the Gulf states
today? In truth
they're the most progressive, not just
today but from the 1960s
Meaning that when the oil wealth was
discovered in Saudi Arabia, early on
what did the country do?
It adopted a project of modernization,
development, education
and medicine. The Saudi Arabia you have
today
is a bastion of global medicine and
science that is exceptional
They have something like 50 universities,
now
Go to the Emirates
or Kuwait. What I'm saying is
these states which are described as
backwards and tribal led a very important
enlightenment drive
Who described them as backwards?
Everyone. The Arab cultural milieu
described the Khaleeji
as backwards and underdeveloped
and that these are tribal states, full of
shepherds and nomads
who happened to find oil, and then went
off to London
Ahmed Mattar even has a poem about this
There are aspects of underdevelopment
which
have occurred as a result of oil discoveries
The sudden wealth that we found
ourselves in
Side effects
Side effects. But what did the Gulf states
do, Faisal? With Saudi Arabia at their head
They adopted a 50-year long project of
development. Make your comparisons
accordingly
What have those other Arab countries
done, which had great education and
and the Arab Awakening, and non-oil
wealth?
What have they done with it?
These regressive systems. The Syrian
regime, the Iraqi regime, the Libyan
regime
These systems were backwards but they
used these symbols and ideologies
of Ba'ath and progressiveness
life and doctrine and so on and so forth
All of this -- what I call nonsense, honestly
-- as compared to the moderation of the
Gulf
where there was a fair distribution of the
wealth
I'm not saying it was always 100% fair
but most of the population of the GCC live
well
They've had jobs, education, and
healthcare since the early 1960s
since the effects of the oil wealth began
to materialize
This isn't all to say that the Gulf states
have a blank slate
or a bias towards these systems
or to say that they're perfect and haven't
made mistakes
or found themselves in trouble
There have been big problems. But I found
this comparison of backward and
progressive to be hurtful, honestly
I feel that even on a popular level
as individuals we have
culture, knowledge, and vision, and yet
there was always
a negative stereotypical image waiting for
us, unfortunately
Where did this image come from? It has
to come from somewhere
It's an organized effort. From political
institutions then cultural
then the media system. Organized work
over many years
truthfully as a way of describing
the Gulf condition, sometimes
consciously, deliberately and sometimes
not
For example, how does Egyptian cinema
portray the Gulf?
The Khaleeji always comes out in a dance
scene, looking like a caricature, in the
background
or a singer imitating the Gulf in a
caricature-like way, and it's honestly very
derogatory
and I personally came out against it more
than once
and I wrote against it more than once. We
should be aware of this
We reject the stereotypical profiling of our
brothers in Egypt or our brothers
in Syria or Algeria or Morocco
We reject profiling of them
even if there are general stereotypes, we
always try to confront them and say
that's not true, but they accept them for
us
For example, I remember when I first
started working at Al Jazeera. They used
to say this guy is only on the screens
because he's Khaleeji. They didn't think it
was because
this person is successful. I mean, you can
see he's successful
and his interviews are successful and his
elocution is great
And he's advancing professionally, but
this misconception went on for a long
time
That, no, it's not because he's qualified. It's
because he's Khaleeji
Of course, I overcame that, but this is a
sad state of affairs
that our Arab brothers need to realize. I
personally promote Arabism and am
a loyal defender of
the Arab condition
but we also paid a price. So some of our
brothers
in the Gulf today, those who are new to
the scene, who were just born a few days
ago
on Twitter engage in attacks and
stereotyping to promote a new kind of
nationalism
in which they want to set a special
standard
a backwards standard that resembles
them and their culture
and knowledge
and they want to measure your patriotism
against that standard or judge your sense
of belonging
to the country or region based on these
warped standards
They don't realize the scale of battles
we've fought. Radical, deep cultural
battles
not for a political system but for our
sociocultural situation in general
which has lasted a long time
So this regressive and progressive
struggle has been
one of the biggest in my life, and
it's one I criticized Muthaffar Al-Nawab for
and which I raised critically with him
And then someone comes along who only
discovered Muthaffar
after he passed away and says so and so
and this is defamation, honestly
What was the response?
Basically, he was saying that these
systems are connected
to the Americans
these systems are ultimately responsible.
There are attempts to hold the Gulf states
responsible
for all the disasters of the Arab world,
honestly
and this is like an epidemic we've been
living with for decades
As though the Gulf is responsible for
Palestine
meaning the Gulf alone is responsible for
the loss of Palestine
This is false and has been repeatedly
refuted
Where do you think it comes from?
I think that having major wealth and a
state of
rapid and sudden change in
the Gulf states
as well as the fact that the Gulf has
excellent relationships with the United
States
and close relationships. So the
assumptions would come from both sides
And from a third side, we could look at
what's being fed by
political, cultural and media systems
which have placed responsibility for all
catastrophes on the Gulf
even Iraq, after the war ended, Saddam
Hussein tried to hold
Kuwait responsible for all the disasters
and crises he and his regime
are solely responsible for
Kuwait is not responsible for their
economic disaster
He wanted $15 billion
He wanted economic support
for a disaster he caused
And Kuwait had provided aid for a long
time
and Saudi Arabia as well
He said he was protecting the east
No, he was protecting himself
He was protecting himself and his Ba'athi,
dictatorial, illegitimate regime
The system in Saudi Arabia is protected by
its people and
the system in Kuwait is protected by the
people
There is popular consent for the ruling
systems in the Gulf
These are systems which are three
hundred years old
They're not systems born today
and these are systems that people feel
connected to and defend
In Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Oman
in Kuwait. These are legitimate systems --
monarchal, dynastic, legitimate systems
However, again, that being said, this isn't
a blank slate
that everything they do is beautiful,
wonderful, and right
but their legitimacy parallels the
legitimacy of
these military, Ba'athist regimes which
became dynastic
When leadership is inherited, such as in a
monarchal or Emiri system
this is normal and represents the will of
the people
But for the head of a regime to pass
leadership to his son, as in Syria
with the support of Leftist intellectuals
and communists and the Syrian National
Party and Leftists in Lebanon
This is a disaster! How can you accept that
the father, a military officer, passes
leadership to his son? and they
wanted to do that
in other countries as well, like Libya and
Egypt
If Saddam Hussein had lived, he would've
passed the leadership to his son as well.
So they're a strange, illogical mix
which is frankly disgusting. Then, they
come and say
You're the one with a backwards, dynastic
system
Our systems are legitimate. Royal systems
are the oldest in the world
But for a Leftist, Socialist
military system to become dynastic and
they amend
the constitution in half an hour to allow
the leadership to be assumed by
a person who is thirty-four years old
So with all these issues you've spoken
about
why are you still faithful to the Arab
cause?
I'll tell you. This is a very important thing.
Let me ask, is privatization good or not?
Privatization is excellent
Not necessarily
Privatization might result in
If your faith is in capitalism, it might
I'm saying your salary might not last 3
days. And privatization can also lead to
excellent services and real development
and community participation and
private sector support and so on
The point is there are no absolute
negatives or positives. I believe we're one
Arab nation
That doesn't mean we're one country, this
is my belief
I believe that from
our people in Mauritania to the borders of
Oman
I think we're one people, one culture, one
civilization, Muslims and Christians
Does that mean we're one country?
Look at Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. How
similar are they? The resemblance
is like 90 percent between them
The resemblance between Saudi Arabia
and the Emirates? 90%
The Emirates and Oman? 90%
What's the difference, in terms of identity,
between a Kuwaiti and a Saudi?
There isn't really much
Maybe how many buttons he has here or
the shape of the collar
or how his sleeve is cut
Imagine that the Pakistani tailor is who
determines the
differences between us, with all due
respect, of course
So I believe in the Arab condition
I believe there are many commonalities
and the evidence is in how involved we
are with each other
Why are we involved with Egypt and vice
versa? Why do we care about Palestine?
Or
Morocco and Algeria?
So you think reality is the evidence?
That's the evidence! I mean, if you look at
the support
and movements provided by
Egypt and Palestine
its intellectuals and educators to the Gulf
states in the 20s and 30s. It was very
significant
before oil. They didn't come for money.
They came because of a feeling of
belonging
A lot came to Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf
So we have commonalities. You are an
Arab
that's how you know yourself. If you sit
with a Tunisian person in any country
you'll find many things in common with
him... or a Mauritanian or
a Sudanese or Somali. So, there's
something in common
However, the regimes that managed the
idea of a formal partnership did it poorly
For example, the United Arab Republic
was managed poorly and disintegrated
quickly
barely lasting a year or so
Does that mean the idea of unity is
wrong? Of course not. The management
was wrong
So what special features does it have?
I'll tell you... The plainest feature
I remember there was a disagreement at
the GCC Summit
in Bahrain, at the end of 2004
I was covering it for Al Jazeera. And I think
Saudi Arabia had an issue
a conflicting matter
that I'm going to tell you about now
If I'm not mistaken, it was about trade
agreements with the United
States of America. Saudi's position was
that we
as a cooperation council should
collectively sign with other parties so we
all receive more benefits
Other members, and Bahrain was one of
them, I think
who signed agreements alone
What's the benefit to signing as a group?
If you sign any economic agreement
collectively?
You get discounts and privileges
You mean it's like the European Union?
First, you get movement and mobility.
Second, benefiting from each other's
wealth. Saudi has oil
Oman has water, for example
The Emirates has such and such. I'm
talking about the Gulf states
So you're talking about it more as an
economic union?
I mean, we could have a form of useful
cooperation. I'm not talking about a
political union
My question is why should there be
Why can't there be
we look for
Why do we look for it?
Because it's not there
No, but I mean, why don't we strive for
globalization? Or
to be more. Globalization would include
the Arab countries
It would include Arab and non-Arab states
So, for example, instead of saying our
cause is Arab, it can be a human one
There's a human connection
There's no problem with that
There are connections with other
countries, with the United Nations
international relations. One doesn't come
at the expense of the other
But Arab relations are the result of
linkages
and commonalities and geographical
borders
We can benefit from them?
These provide great possibilities. In
addition, we are an Arab nation with our
own identity
We have our religion, our language, our
culture
our history, so then why shouldn't we
work
together? Today, even in the GCC
no one acts as though it's one country
under one command
Kuwait has its own system. It's the same
with Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia,
and the Emirates
but people look forward to what? We look
forward
to more cooperation and
the GCC countries offer an excellent
model. I mean, it's the best united system
that
the Arab world has seen. We had the Gulf
crisis, which caused problems, but
it's done, and we overcame it
Today it's clear there's been a return to
strong Gulf relations, which is excellent
That's a very good thing
What connects Saudi Arabia to Lebanon?
The Lebanese encourage this
involvement. Of course, there are those
who prefer Iran
But we're speaking about Arab Lebanese
who want Saudi interference
who want Saudi influence
Why? Because they feel that there's
something in common
Why does Saudi Arabia get involved?
Because it feels obligated
to help and support like it did with Iraq
and with Syria for a long time, with Jordan
with Yemen for a long time. Today,
unfortunately
if you're not present, there's an enemy
waiting to exploit that
to work against you and your fellow Arabs.
I'm saying there's
a need for a common Arab condition. The
shape and model
whether it's one political system, I think
that would be extremely hard
Ok, since we've arrived at Lebanon let's
talk about Hanthala
and the Palestinian cause. I know the
Palestinian cause is very important to you
It's important to every Arab
Of course, but since we have you with us
today, Bu Salman
This is recording a position
It's important to me, personally
But today there's a new
thought, but before we get into it, and I
don't really
want to get into it
honestly, because it doesn't interest me
and
I don't think it interests the listeners, but I
wanted to talk about your interest
in the Palestinian cause
Why do you think we need to keep this
cause alive today and defend it?
There are general reasons and specific
reasons
The general reasons are those
which urge every Arab to talk about
Palestine
and love of Palestine because it's our
central issue
because we're connected to it as Arabs
and Muslims, because it's part of our
larger
Arab world, because it's the most
monstrous occupation and apartheid
state in the world today
because it's the biggest injustice humans
have experienced in modern times
This is one thing. Secondly
Palestine serves a purpose, Faisal.
Palestine has a function beyond being
Palestine
and a land for her people and for her
nation's children
as well as being a religious and Arab
cradle. Palestine has a function
It defines us as Arabs, as a special function
The truth is
whenever anything happens in Palestine,
for example, a
Zionist assault on Al-Aqsa, war on the
Gaza Strip, the first Intifada
the second Intifada, what happens in the
Arab world? There's an uproar
Why? Because the fact is that Palestine
reminds us who we are, our identity
our duty, our very being. So this is a
function
the Palestinian cause serves in addition to
a lot of other great things
So truthfully it's a bond that connects us
The fact is, at the beginning of the
twentieth century
the modern Arab state was established,
after colonialism
and our Arab states were drawn in a
grotesque and
unnatural way, thanks to Sykes-Picot, etc
Palestine is the only nation that didn't
survive
this massacre, this process of
fragmentation that took place
So we all bear that burden. The Arab
armies tried
the Arab states tried. Arab notables.
Everyone was committed to the
Palestinian cause
Even today. There's official
commitment to the question of Palestine.
All states are committed, with
possible exceptions now with
normalization, but I remember
Saudi Arabia is the biggest economic
supporter of
the Palestinian people. They're always the
biggest supporter and
things have been said about Saudi Arabia
doing this and that
But they've proven day after day that
there's firm Saudi
commitment to the Palestinian cause
And events over the last
three or four years is proof
Statements by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, by the Diwan
by the government. They always express
this commitment
I speak about Saudi Arabia because it's my
country and it's a leader
Saudi Arabia today is the leading
and central state of the Arab world
It plays excellent roles and the hope is
that it will continue to do so
Given your knowledge and experience in
media, the Western media
deal with Palestine and the Palestinian
cause
in a way which is unfair and
western media is very influential
People think that the western media, or
assumes that it
approaches matters honestly
No, the media knows it's dishonest
So what's happening?
What's happening is control by lobbyists
and struggles between major interests
Firstly, of the main western powers are
responsible for these crimes
which are committed against the
Palestinians. From America to Britain
Britain started it
but America has continued to support it
and considers
Israel to be its base in the Middle East, and
therefore it is
responsible for everything that's
happened there
the theft of Jerusalem, theft of land,
settlements
So it's a coordinated effort?
This is the position of the political systems
Western media institutions are ideological
institutions, no matter what Arab liberals
say
The western media is ideological
and biased completely
But don't you think all media institutions
are biased?
Yeah, of course, why else would it
compare itself to others?
Why does it make claims to
professionalism and
objectivity? It's not true. I mean
aside from what the media claims to be or
do
they are biased when dealing with a case
like Palestine
Look at the incident with our late,
esteemed colleague
Shireen Abu Akleh, look at what
happened. The Western media covered it
They couldn't do the harm they usually do
but look at how Reuters and the BBC
covered it
The Washington Post called it
a "death"
Death as though it was a confrontation
between equals
Is there an equivalence between a
journalists and a Zionist soldier with a
high-caliber weapon?
The point is that the Western media does
this and is biased towards official policy
and always has been
The Western media is never objective
unless it's to do with intellectual matters
in their own communities. Other than
that, it's not objective
When we talk about the western media
who came to the area
specifically when American troops came
to
Iraq in 2003, some call it an invasion. In
2003
At the time, you had graduated from
Kuwait
the College of Education?
Kuwait University
Yes, at the Public Institute for Applied
Education
Pardon me, yes, and you also studied
psychology then you moved into media,
working for Saudi television
Then you were a reporter in 2003 in Iraq?
I wasn't a reporter exactly. I was only there
a while
Radio broadcaster. You worked with the
radio for a little while
and that was the first time you really
encountered the foreign media
specifically in a hotel called Palestine
Hotel
We were in Mustansiriya College. That was
the headquarters and
the journalists were in Palestine Hotel
You were with them and saw how they
worked?
And you mentioned two organizations
The Associated Press
and Reuters
At the time you said they control global
media in general
Do you still feel they have this control?
I think it's still there, if perhaps not as
much
meaning what?
The idea is that the world's major news
agencies are the main source of news that
all other media institutions draw from
They're the first port. They produce an
enormous amount of news
and they have. offices in most countries in
the world
so they produce a great deal of political,
economic, and sports news
as a wire service. And then news
channels, whether Al Jazeera or Al Arabiya
Sky News, all the news channels in the
region.. BBC Arabic, all channels
What are the producers doing there?
Where is the news coming from?
The news comes from two main sources
either from the channel's offices, from
correspondents in Palestine, in Egypt
anywhere, in America. Or from the
agencies
Agencies provide a huge influx of news
They had the most control over what was
published in the media
Even Kuwaiti newspapers, look at
Al-Qabas, what's the source of the news?
AFP, Reuters, from these sources. So, this
flood of
news is what determines global priorities
Imagine, you're a journalist
working for a newspaper in Kuwait or
Egypt
on television in Morocco or in radio in
Oman and you need news items, where
will you get it?
You don't have reporters. Or if you do, they
can only get you two or three pieces of
news
So you turn to the wire services and see
what they have
Those priorities will set your schedule
First, this event is most important, so
that's where you start
immediately. Secondly
they offer you guidance on how to present
this news
How?
In the mechanism, the text, the language
It makes a huge difference
For example, when we're talking about Ali
and Faisal, and you want to report
something that happened
You can do so in a way that's positive for
me or a way that's good for you
The same event, the same facts. And you
could also present it
in a third way, which we would call the
objective narrative where you try to relay
events as they happened
Are there media companies that present
the news objectively?
They try to, but they're not completely
objective. Objectivity is
a relative matter. It's not like a checklist
if I tick them all, then I'm objective
It's a very complicated matter
but I think there are institutions
that try, and Al Jazeera is one of them
which are in a constant quest for
objectivity
Now, in the book you wrote, after your
experiences in Iraq
"Everything that happened on this
difficult and frustrating journey
has radically transformed my thinking"
I've forgotten the book, to be honest. It
was
written a while ago. It's a pamphlet,
written at the request of friends
and I wrote it in a short time, during the
Arab Spring
So I thought, ok, let me write some
reflections
It was a record of events and impressions
and emotions etc. So it's not an official
reference
No, it was just part of our preparation for
the interview
The idea is important though, for sure
In Iraq, many things changed for me
When I went to Baghdad
as a reporter, I saw what the real press
was like
Real channels, and how reporters went
out for stories. And I was from a humble
institution, radio
without a lot of experience in this area
or caring about all the political news
I saw people from all over the world and I
saw Baghdad
For the first time?
The first and the last time, until now, I
mean
Oh, so it was just that time?
Just then. I remember we went out
with a group. Someone was pointing to
places and mocking them
I was upset by that. Of course
our position is against Saddam Hussein's
regime. But I mean, this is Iraq and this is
Baghdad
Soldiers coming from everywhere
wreaking havoc on the country and
destroying it
Suddenly these political parties and sects
appear
And, of course, Baghdad wasn't in a good
condition
There was a war, so nothing was
functioning. People didn't live well
Nothing was open. It was always dark, no
electricity
at night. And the image
of Baghdad in our minds is of something
great
Baghdad is mentioned in poems,
literature, and culture
Who of us doesn't like Baghdad?
Who doesn't love Baghdad? Who doesn't
long to see Baghdad? So I
had the opportunity... at what age? In
2003
I was 27 or 26 years old
So I was a young man filled with Arabism
and anger
and hopes and dreams
so I was fated to be in Baghdad at this
historical moment
that represents, not Iraq's breakdown, but
the breakdown of our Ummah
our defeat as a nation
Our defeat in the person of Saddam
Hussein and the West
who came to remove Saddam Hussein and
those who've come
after Saddam Hussein and those who will
come after that
It's very unfortunate. I ask myself
sometimes
When did we last have
good times in the Arab world? When did
we win? When did we feel like a strong
nation? A
moderate nation led by good ideas and
people
are able to lead good lives in it
The Abbasid era
Ah, so we have to go back 1,000 years. It's
a catastrophe. So at that moment
I broke. I mean, I've had many difficult
times in my life
but we hope that difficult times
lead to better things in the future. So
seeing Baghdad at that time
was very painful
And at that time I decided to work for
other channels
to get out of that work
Government media is not like the real
thing
What's the difference?
It's completely different. All government
television and media
whether in Kuwait or Egypt or elsewhere
So I decided to express this and made the
decision
and I think I discovered
in myself a talent... or figured out that I
can do as others do, so it was
just a year, and then I moved to Al Jazeera.
There, I think, in its coverage
one is able to speak and comment on
events
because the channel's covering news and
political events, 24 hours a day. So as a
journalist
you can express yourself
There's space.
We've spent 20 years expressing ourselves
and we're still angry
And I don't think this anger will end
because there don't seem
to be any major signs
of transformation in our Arab world. I
speak as an Arab
about our Arab Ummah
I'm not talking about a particular country
or place
We want to talk a bit about Al Jazeera
and what things were like at the start
from what I understood, reading your
book, that you tried to
as much as you could
to create a space where you could
conduct certain interviews which
reflected your thoughts, your character
and viewpoint. So entering Al Jazeera
how did you feel?
I was excited but also nervous. I mean,
you're among the best
journalists and broadcasters in the Arab
world, one of
the most important Arab news
institutions, Al Jazeera channel
As the English say, "best of the best", so
you come to this place, and I mean, the
truth is I'm a simple man
I feel myself to be a simple man. I'm not
one who boasts
I am highly cultured and educated. My
language skills have been
above average since I was a child. And I
know I was a good presenter
of the news during that period... to a
certain extent, of course
not anything extraordinary
And, of course, I came in fully confident
I applied and did a
pilot experimental bulletin for them. I was
accepted within a week
the contract was signed. And
I started working immediately
Do you remember your first bulletin?
The first one was a 3pm brief
I wore an awful bullet-silver suit
I'd bought it 3 years before and took it
from place to place
it lasted almost two years
I never changed it. So, I presented the
brief and everyone
at Al Jazeera, even the technical
department
Al Jazeera's technical department is
honestly a wonderful
mix of people, mostly Qatari, who are very
innovative
At the time we had a director, if I
remember
it might have been Jaber Al-Athba
during the pilot or the first brief
so there was a welcoming after
this brief came out
The performance was good. Then, they
moved me to the night which no one
watches
I stayed that way for two months, on the
nightshift, at three in the morning
until a turning point came
which moved me to the middle of the day
So, you were there for about six years, and
then the Arab Spring happened
I was in the news, Faisal, from 2004 to
2009
Presenting the news?
I presented news program
rotating with colleagues and presented
some of the major programmes
Honestly, there was a great deal of
support from the administration
Because you're a Khaleeji?
Maybe at first, but then they found out it
was a matter of professionalism
I mean, I interviewed Gaddafi in 2006
along with a colleague
He's the first major figure you
interviewed?
Yes, and after that I was able to interview
many
great intellectuals. I always chaired New
Year's discussions
and there was a lot of confidence,
honestly
from the administration
so I began covering everything
American elections in 2008, the Lebanese
war in 2006
all of Kuwait's elections, which we have
practically every day
2006, 2007, 2008, I covered
them all. I covered the Gulf Cooperation
Council Summit in Bahrain
You were very active in this period?
I was a news broadcaster and a reporter in
the field
This was a time when Khaleejis didn't
know me yet
I was agitating alone
People didn't really care for political news
channels, unless it was their field
Everything changed in 2010, 2009, when I
started my in-depth show
Then there was more interest from the
public in the Gulf. Before that, some
people knew me, but
it was higher-level
So, you met Qaddafi in 2006?
2006, online
I spoke to him by satellite
and said, Saddam Hussein is gone
who do you think is next?
or something to that effect. Honestly, I
was spiteful towards the man
God have mercy on the dead
I don't want to speak ill of the dead
but he was a politician
He presented ideas which were honestly
hilarious and deserved to be mocked
and he disparaged other parties
which I found unacceptable
I feel for anyone who suffers injustice
and I feel protective over my people
So he was a man who did these things
and people weren't comfortable with our
interview
there was some feedback, but the point of
the question
and Gaddafi never answers, of course
he deflects and goes in circles
Conversationally, was he clever?
No, not a all. He was always running from
questions
You ask about apples, his answer's about
oranges
But he needs to have some sort of ability
to lead, doesn't he?
His abilities are in repression and tyranny
That's what he's good at?
That's what kept him the leader of the
country for 40 years or whatever it was
Now some people say
or recall that when you sit with him,
personally, he doesn't act
as crazy as he does in public or
on the screen. He can speak naturally. I
don't know, people say
But as he appears to us
in the media. He speaks in a way that
disregards people. He doesn't see anyone.
He's conceited
Once he spoke at the Arab summit in
Damascus, and I think he said some
accurate things
about Iraq and what not, and I think
it was only out of fear for himself and his
regime. It was the only time
he was serious. Usually he spoke in a
stupid and mocking manner
looking down on people with disdain
I mean God have mercy on the man
So in 2009 was the first episode of your
show, In Depth
let's talk about the show
I know each episode was meant to focus
on a particular idea or subject
and it was on Al Jazeera
Were you choosing guests?
You were preparing everything?
The space was there for you. I'm saying
this
because I want to get into
the question of bias at the channel. I
mean, I think every channel has certain
biases
and Al Jazeera is no more guilty than
others of this
given that it's a media channel
What I want to discuss, in a objective way,
is the media machine
which is biased and you, as a journalist,
have personal biases on certain issues as
well
I want to understand how you moved
within this space and highlighted issues
you thought were important
I think at the start, and since I was the
presenter
and producer
This wasn't a program I was broadcasting
from my house
I was presenting from the Al Jazeera
channel, an institution with
standards and rules of professionalism
that must be adhered to
but Al Jazeera always provides space
especially in its programs. The space is
there to contribute, even in a news
bulletin
even news programs like Behind the
News, etc. There's a lot of space
On the show, I had even more leeway and
it's because
you're up to the task and you know how
to do
these things and how not to break the
rules of
professionalism and keep to the general
line of
this media institution. So, in the show, I
was
really able to push the causes I believe in,
such as
those concerning the Arab condition
issues with an intellectual dimension
These topic needed to be prominent
So we chose such topics. I mean, we
discussed the state of higher education
in the Arab world
We discussed economic issues
oil revenues in the Gulf
We discussed many causes from Morocco,
such as the Amazigh identity
democracy in Kuwait
democracy in Kuwait, all these things
Did you see any results from it?
To be honest, it echoed well
its impact on recipients was excellent
The interaction that followed was also
high in terms of quality
This was my role
But to change reality is not the role of the
press
Of course I wasn't dealing with immediate
issues in the news
so there isn't a direct effect. You know
that news programs
deal with what's happening now, for
example, at the Ministry of the Interior in
Kuwait
Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia,
Ministry of Finance in Egypt. So such
cases
if addressed and I've discovered a problem
with them
it might lead to change. These are news
programs. My show
was concerned with long-term intellectual
and strategic issues
And so, I think the impact of the show was
on consciousness
I think we were able to influence a Gulf
generation and that was big for me
that I really felt
I felt the interaction from young people in
the Gulf
at the time podcasts were just coming out
and I didn't even know what a podcast
was
They would ask why doesn't the show
come as a podcast?
Al Jazeera had podcasts
that students listened to abroad
I was also asked about Youtube
which had excellent engagement
Then I began attending
events and activities in the Gulf and
across the Arab world
and I felt the impact on a generation in
the Gulf
which was a source of pride to me and
great appreciation
What do you think is the role of a media
figure today?
I mean, any media has the role of
imparting knowledge on people
in a correct way. A media figure has a role
in consciousness
meaning they're aware of the details of
things
Matters appear to us other than what they
are and
things may be invisible and so on
So, the mission of the media
is to create awareness and influence the
way
people think and interact with events and
life, in general
When the media presents an idea to you
and says
It's like this, it's like that, and so on
supposedly the effect of that
is to change the way you deal with this
thing, to make it different or better
I see
For people to know what their rights are,
how things are run... this is the function of
the media
But just to be a clear, today's media
in general, all the media
is politicized or biased, let's say
They've got their policies and their own
projects, so with media
for me, I have to know what this channel
is, its policies, before I even start reading
Not even just who funds it, but what's its
ideology
before I read the news article
I need to understand where the channel's
coming from
maybe because it's important to me.
Others might not care so much
So do you think today's media mission is a
good one?
Firstly, it's an incorrect assumption that
the media is a public service or a charity
The media is not a charitable organization.
It's based on work
I mean
on the desire of everyone who works
in the field
But the media as an institution is not
a charity or non-profit institution at all
Secondly, it's not the media's job to
perform all roles
You're assuming that this medium has to
do everything
When do we get a good result, Faisal?
It's when the media is balanced. Let's
assume we have two media companies
One is liberal capitalist, the other is Leftist
Or like Fox and CNN?
For example, although that's Right
CNN? I don't think it's liberal
or represents liberal currents
Of course, this is difficult for the recipient
The recipient takes what he can
at the end from where he can
But the elite should be able to weigh the
performance of different channels,
meaning
Fox presents something or deals with the
news in a certain way
and CNN deals with it in a particular way,
so you should be able to distinguish
between them
What does each channel want?
What do the groups controlling them
want?
and what do other groups want?
This gives you an ability to balance them
I think one media institution is not
enough
I remember when I used to read the
newspapers in Kuwait
for example. I liked Al-Qabas, Al-Anba, and
Al-Watan
I wasn't satisfied with just one. And this is
before
I started working in media. I loved
getting three newspapers
They're inexpensive, of course, and
available
So I read three papers, and I would take
notice, almost unintentionally
what the headline was in this newspaper
versus that one that one
Or if there was one major issue, how were
they each presenting it
So, you create some balance
and the newspapers I mentioned
aren't necessarily run on political currents,
but maybe business interests
or intellectual groups and maybe even
political ones
The point is that by following more than
one media source
you can achieve some balance
It's not one media source's job to offer you
everything
And now social media has provided access
to a large amount of news sources
Right. So, while you were at Al Jazeera
the Arab Spring began, which I want to
get into
Before the Arab Spring the media, in
general, shaped
public opinion, but with
social media and the revolutions we saw,
first in Tunisia
then Egypt, we noticed a grassroots
movement
from the street pressuring official or
private media, and
they wanted you, as Al Jazeera for
example, to consider both sides
I want to understand what happened at
this time
First, it was this sudden explosion which
wasn't really sudden
but it was surprising in many respects
It was an explosion caused by the impact
of modern media and social media
that appeared in the middle of 2005,
2006... Facebook, specifically
People had access to platforms they could
express themselves with
and communicate through
The revolution in Egypt was the result of
pages that arose on Facebook
Khalid Said and others
which drove things. So there was a lot
engagement there. There was also a
regression in the performance of systems
I think institutions were in a phase of
regression in terms of
politics and the economy, precisely
and we hadn't sensed that
For example, Tunisia was presented as a
model of growth
according to IMF standards
and the World Bank, for reasons that
weren't necessarily economic
but political or related to services
provided by the state
It didn't reflect reality?
No, there was a lot of tampering in it and
the revolutions are evidence of that
The point is there were economic, political
and social problems
There was also social media engagement
and new forms of communication
It all came together
and created these enormous uprisings we
saw in
more than one Arab country. And we had
enthusiasm for some
thinking they might be a source of change
or a way out
but they weren't always. It wasn't in Syria
In Tunisia, yes, change happened
In Libya, no. In Yemen, something
has happened in this matter. People
sometimes
hold you responsible for the Arab Spring
as a large media sector
Officials, ministers
and media figures supported the Arab
Spring then
but they were able to conceal it or walk it
back. The point is there's no shame in it
We had sympathy for people who were
victims of their countries
I had a clear position on it, and I was even
accused, people said
When the revolution comes to the Gulf
you'll be against it. Of course, I'd be
against it
because there are no grounds for
revolution in the Gulf
Simple as that. If you want to call me
a hypocrite or say I have double standards,
that's not true
The Gulf states are quite different
The Gulf states need some improvements
and
we've talked about them and written
about them
But revolution? No one calls for that, no
one supports it. I, personally and honestly
think that
and I wrote about this clearly and
definitively. So, these revolutions
happened
We sympathized with the victims and
supported the youth in more than
one country, believing that
there was injustice
but the battles were tough and
tragic and bloody, and this is shared
The revolution doesn't bear responsibility
for that
It lies with the regimes that dealt with the
revolutions
in a bloody manner and produced these
disasters
People who rose up to lift injustice from
themselves and others aren't to blame
The blame goes to the regimes that dealt
with this violently
leading to these disasters and which are
still there
This is the story of the Arab Spring, in
summary
What were things like at Al Jazeera then?
Al Jazeera was a beehive. No doubt it was
the most influential and only
not the only channel, all of them provided
major coverage
But Al Jazeera was on
24 hour a day, reacting to events
and obviously the channel supported
these people's movements
So there was always movement
and emotion in the newsroom, and I was
part of that
with faith and conviction
Do you remember your meeting with
Muhammad Salim Al-Awa?
Yes, Muhammad Salim Al-Awa, the doctor,
God save him
I think they went as a group to promote
dialogue
I interviewed him live, and it was a long
interview
and I might have been a bit harsh with
him
Now we want to speak of the post-
revolutionary period
since we've spoken about the revolutions
what do you think of our condition after
the Arab Spring?
The Arab Spring is over
The uprising are done, with differences
from one country to another
In some countries it led to a kind of
victory
for example, in Tunisia, which was
reversed
and reverted to how it was. Egypt
is different. Syria was bloody and violent
and all my sympathy goes to them
because it's a tragedy, a real tragedy, and
they've been let down
And there was an international conspiracy
at work
by vicious regimes against the Syrian
people
clearly, whether Russia or Iran, in a way
where
the Syrian people didn't stand a chance in
this huge and cruel confrontation
Hurtful things have been written
The problem is if you
care about people and I do
It hurts all parties. The truth is some
regimes don't deserve to stay in power
in light of what they've committed in
terms of crimes and massacres
They can't stay and
I don't think anyone would accept it
There are regimes that managed to get
past it
and arrive at a middle ground
In my opinion, historical settlements are
the solution
that's not based on analysis, just my
personal opinion
even if I get judged harshly for it, I mean
Historical settlements are the solution
They're the only way out. And it doesn't
mean
forgetting
it's just to come to a fair settlement for all
parties and to try
to get away from the past and look
towards the future of each individual
country
In an interview for the first episode after
my return, Faisal
I went to Rwanda for the first episode and
met Paul Kagame
Rwanda saw the biggest massacre in
modern times
Millions died within days or a month
What Paul Kagame did was push forward
a historic settlement
which happened. A settlement between
factions of the civil war
And the fact is that today Rwanda
is in a much better situation than it was
In fact, it's probably the most developed
country in Africa
And he's been in power since 2000, by the
way, so it's not a full democracy
and I personally am not
a believer in democracy as a sacred thing
I'm with systems remaining and
stabilizing
and even extending them. I mean,
systems that depend on
elections because stable rule leads to a
stable
public life, in society, in the economy and
so on
If the ruler has a vision. Not like what we
had in the Arab world, stability for 40
years and run by
a crazy person. You can't be led for 40
years by
a mad man with no vision and when he
dies he says
I'm going to pass this onto my son, who
then introduces new and neoliberal
reforms
He releases a few detainees and says
I'm a reformer and then extends his rule
another 40 years
No, that's a big lie
I'm talked about long-lasting rule for
systems with a vision in republics
which have a vision and plan and believe
in historical
settlements and launches genuine and
serious calls for dialogue
which releases people from detentions
and prisons and allows those in exile to
return
and allows citizens to participate in
building their country
I think even the revolutionary parties, or
what can be called revolutionary
parties have less demands. Less dreams
and more modest
They've realized the gravity of matters and
the importance of stability
The gravity of matters, in what way?
The dangers of revolutions and what they
bring in terms of pain
the collapse of societies, the division of
nations
the collapse of security, these are all risks
Now this is a necessary evil in processes of
radical
change that eradicate existing systems
I think they've become aware of this
and are looking for partial improvements
and stability
an environment that allows
everyone to live. And thus all parties now
the initiative comes from where? It's with
the ruling system
There was a call recently in Egypt
I heard a while ago, at the end of
Ramadan or after Eid
I think it was the end of Ramadan
and I hope and pray it succeeds
Some say this and some say that. Some
like it, some don't
In my opinion
Egypt is a major and important nation and
its stability
Its growth and success are in all of our
interests
and therefore, we hope Egypt returns.
Syria is a large and
important country. We hope Syria is
united and millions of Syrians return to it
of course, by a different settlement
Egypt is a completely different situation
from that of Syria. Iraq has been
lost and is controlled today by... I mean,
God willing, it returns
These are pillars of the Arab world Iraq,
Syria, Egypt
Saudi Arabia, which is stable and well
advanced
but you need these
parties to cooperate so that they can
revive. So, historical
settlements, agreements, under terms the
people agree to
It's not me who decides what they are
I think this is the only way out
I believe that confrontation, hatred,
incitement and arrests will not lead
anything. It will lead to nothing and
accomplish nothing
There is only dialogue, reconciliation,
settlements and reform
Thank you
Bu Salman, I'd like to get into some
questions, dealing with you more
personally
You used to write articles but not anymore
with everything you've been saying here
I'd love to read your articles and thoughts.
Why'd you stop?
I don't have the desire, honestly, and
articles require
decorum and a position
An article is supposed to declare a
position
to hold a position on issues
But you have positions
No, I've given up positions. I mean, I have
my opinions but I don't publish them or
announce them
Doing so can get you into a lot of trouble
and honestly, there are things which
aren't worth the effort. So writing articles
is a
strenuous mental activity requiring a
position, so I decided to stop
Do you go through periods of despairing
at the state of media?
Yes and no
You want to say n and you want to say yes
Yes, there are times when you despair at
the state of it
but I never believed or surrendered to it
because I always believe
in renewal and the media is linked
to politics and presents it
The better the politics, the better the
media, that's it
When things are better politically, then
the media is better, has more vitality and
is more hopeful
The important thing is the politics, not us
in the media
Right, so since we're talking politics, you
were a bit absent during the Gulf crisis
What did you think, from a professional
distance but being a Gulf citizen?
It's unfortunate, of course
when a problem arises in your house or
between relatives
It's terrible
For it to happen between states that you
belong to, that you love her
between Saudi Arabia and Qatar
These are two countries I'm very
connected to
In addition to the Emirates and Bahrain.
These are our countries that we love and
appreciate
And Egypt, of course. But my personal
connection is greatest with Kuwait
Saudi Arabia and Qatar. So it was painful
and I felt pity
for the situation we were in and hope that
it would resolve quickly
and thank God it's over, and settled with a
good vision
Saudi Arabia and the rest of the states
have adhered to it excellently
I think Saudi Arabia led well and helped
end this
crisis quickly and
it's over. I think relations today are at a
good level
and I like that in
Saudi's case, they're trying to close many
files... the Yemeni war
which was initiated by Iran and the Houthi
militias, and which forced
Saudi Arabia to respond
Today this has also burdened the Ummah
so Saudi's trying to build relationships and
bridges
with all states, Turkey, even Iran they've
negotiations. And we always say that Iran
is a neighbouring Muslim nation. We don't
hate them, for sectarian reasons
or any other. We consider them brothers.
This was before they did what they did in
the Arab world, which resulted in a
situation
that made Saudi Arabia an enemy and
posed a threat to stability
in the Arab world. It began in Iraq,
Lebanon, Syria and Yemen
and Saudi Arabia was therefore
duty-bound to do
what it did, and there was a need for more
Arab support which there wasn't
Unfortunately, Arab support has not been
provided
but Saudi Arabia responded to this
matter, and I think it struck a balance with
Iran
Today there are negotiations and
conversations
about positive relationships, and I think
if matters improve between Saudi Arabia
and Iran
it will stabilize the region in a big way
because Iran is the source of tension
and Saudi Arabia is trying to play the
firefighter
and support stability. Saudi Arabia has
never been a source of instability in Arab
states
Not in Yemen, not in Iraq, in Syria, in
Lebanon
Iran has always been the source of
tension, supporting groups, militias, etc
So, today, if it is agreed that Iran will cease
its hand in this
region, work as a real neighbor, as they
proclaim to the world
I think... This is also something that can be
linked to the Gulf crisis
The crisis is over. Perhaps some of the
burning issues in the area can be
alleviated
We hope Egypt will regain its power
and vitality, for Iraq to regain its strength
and life
and for Syria to regain its sovereignty
and vitality and work with Saudi Arabia,
with Qatar
Qatar is an active country in the region
doing things of great importance,
developing
and sophisticated. And we all, of course
hope that Kuwait will regain its historic
role
Kuwait, during the Gulf crisis, played the
most important role
recalling its historical roles
Some might say that's glowing talk and
too optimistic, but it's not
It's true. These are words
that represent our hopes
If we don't restore the energy, vitality and
stability of these countries, we have no
future
And we stand with our countries, because
we're standing with ourselves and our
children
and what awaits them, which is a real
unknown future
in light of these places that are still
troubled
whether in Iraq... Lebanon, there's hardly a
country left
Have you been recently?
No, but I've been following up on the
economic situation
People's savings have vanished
Syria is no longer a country
I mean
the regime has become like the head of a
department representing regional
and external forces. In Iraq there are
significant problems
We want our nations to have their their
strength and vitality back
Bu Salman, you just mentioned Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, and Qatar
You grew up in Kuwait
your country is Saudi Arabia and your
professional life was in Qatar
Do you think this has resulted in any kind
of identity crisis for you?
Of course it has, but we don't say crisis
I don't mean crisis
I use the word too but because we want to
talk about it
Firstly
There is no crisis of identity. The Saudi
identity is the Kuwaiti identity is the
Qatari identity
There's no difference. I told you, it's just in
the clothes
There are minor differences
We spoke about that but I meant for you
personally
There's some turmoil. To grow up as a
Saudi in Kuwait and work
as a Kuwaiti in Saudi Arabia causes some
tumult
When I worked there, colleagues looked
at me as though I was from Kuwait
Then you try and solve it in Qatar, a third
country, where they don't know
is this guy Saudi or Kuwaiti? So there is
some difficulty in it
But it's an advantage too
when you're in certain places, you can be
Qatari with Qataris, Saudi with Saudis
I understand Kuwait well and its society
I understand Saudi Arabia excellently
its culture and society. I understand Qatar
well at the cultural
political and societal levels. This is an
advantage. And they all feel like I'm one of
them
Saudis felt that I was Saudi and Kuwait,
too
Qatar also and this emerged after the end
of the crisis
And I am proud that I am Saudi, and I feel
proud to be Kuwaiti pride
and I feel very proud to be
Qatari. Maybe this is sentimental, but I
really do feel pride deep inside me
When I talk about Qatar
I feel a bit of pride in my experience there
When we talk about Saudi Arabia
I feel a lot of love and pride
For this long, stable,
developing and evolving system and
progress being made today
Something big is going on in Saudi Arabia,
major developments
administratively, economically
It's become one of the most attractive
places
for the economy or investment. This is
very important
There have been major developments in
the society, in education, in health
Kuwait is one of the greatest countries in
the world
Kuwaitis are full of confidence, boldness,
knowledge, freedom
distinction and comedy. Everything.
When you watch a Kuwaiti play
or TV show... I'm talking about back in the
glory days
When you look at
the Kuwaiti youth, when you see the
pioneers
you find many great things in
There are negatives, of course, in Saudi
Arabia, in Kuwait, and in Qatar
but I'm focusing on the positives
I've decided to focus on the positives now
and say nothing negative
So I don't get into any trouble. Everyone is
good
I'd like to ask you some questions I'm
personally interested in
You've asked every question possible now
Just a few more
I know we've taken a lot of your time
If you'd allow coffee and smoking, we'd be
good! No, no go ahead
There was a difficult interview you did
on your program, In Depth
which, for me, was completely different to
the others
You've interviewed thinkers and
philosophers
heads of state, foreign ministers, and
artists
which was the hardest interview you
remember?
or a certain character?
Abdul Karim Abdelkader
That's a recent one
Because I don't want to bring up a big
issue that we'd have to get into. It wasn't
difficult
in a negative way
Firstly, I don't have artists on the show
artist.
unless they're political
Like Saad Al-Faraj
He's political. He has a position on issues
I had on Jamal Suleiman, a political artist
and intellectual
Bu Khalid [Abdel Karim Abdelkadir] is a
great personality
but the interview was purely about art
so it was a bit of a struggle. I love Bu
Khalid, he's a great guest
because he's very important and that
should be documented
but it was a new experience for me
to have on an artist with no political issues
What's strange is that after your long
experience
in the field, you found this recent
interview difficult
It wasn't a professional difficult, more on
the personal level. In the end we did it and
it was great
but
I meant to step into an area that's not
yours and
there's no politics. It's purely a technical
matter
which I'm not well-versed in
I rarely ever describe an interview
as hard because you prepare for an
interview
and you have a team helping you
and you're even choosing the guest
so it's not difficult. Unless the guest has
difficulties communicating their ideas, for
example
How was Erdogan when you interviewed
him?
Fine. Erdogan will talk for hours without
stopping
We did two interviews with him over four
hours
We agreed on half an hour but I continued
with him for an hour
or more for part one
then an hour and a half for the second
part. He's a friendly man
Did you feel like it was difficult to get to
his thoughts and ideas?
It's a give and take
Presidents are diplomatic. They don't
speak transparently about things
Also for presidents, where interviews
usually have some formality and protocol
I'm uncomfortable with it... That's why in
the new season
we've moved on to the world of ideas and
thinkers and intellectuals
these are the areas
I like, not the world of presidents. There's
really not much for me
What's the most important characteristic
you focus on as an interviewer?
Or that you focus on during interviews?
To express the questions of the viewers
In reality the viewer
follows you and unconsciously
takes your perspective
Looking at the guest from your corner
So they hope you ask questions that come
to their mind
Either the questions they're waiting for or
which come to mind during the interview
That's the most important thing
for an interviewer to represent the viewer
So what's the interview that had the
greatest personal impact on you, Bu
Salman?
which changed you or
your convictions or anything
Honestly, Faisal, I'm trying to think of
something extraordinary but actually
every interview leaves a little influence on
you
You interviewed Azmi Bshara a lot
Azmi Bshara I used to interview him quite
a lot in the old days
intellectually
at that time
I was affected byhis thinking for a while
and the things he was saying
In-Depth
when you asked, I thought just meant an
interview
If no one comes to mind, it's fine. It's not a
problem
Saad Al-Faraj left an impact on me
since we mentioned him and Bu Bader is
a true artist
even while answering your questions. You
feel his emotions
You feel his honesty and that this man is a
real artist with a long career
He wrote about the Kuwait of 2000 back
in 1964
and when he talks about his childhood
in Fintas and the village, and how he
ended up in the theatre
and is still there
May God give him health and wellness
and he's offering new works
Saad Al-Faraj's character left an
impression on me
I went to his office once and he spoke to
me about Fintas
He'll sit for an hour talking about it
His memory is incredible. And these
experiences need to be documented
Yesterday, his son, Bader, told me the
same thing
that someone needs to document it
Specifically he meant Fintas, that no one
has documented the area and its people
and history
What's the hardest news you ever
reported?
The death of Ali Al Jaber, the mercy of God
on him
in 2011, in Libya, our colleague, a senior
photographer
It was emotional news. Ali Al Jaber was a
great person
We had a wonderful friendship, so I was
very affected by it
Very, very much... to have to announce it
Can we play the video of it?
Yes, it's a tragic event, of course. The
urgent news is the death of our colleague
Ali Hassan Al Jaber, head of the
photography department at Al Jazeera
in an ambush the channel's was exposed
to
in the Hawari area southwest of
Benghazi city
Al Jazeera correspondent Nasser Hadar
was also wounded by heavy gunfire
And the last bit, Muneera?
I saw it before. The end of it
Our condolences for the loss
Ali Al Jaber, may God have mercy on him,
was
a great man. At a personal level, for me
and to every colleague at Al Jazeera
It's clearly very difficult. I just wanted to
share it because here
you're trying to do your job as a
broadcaster
You try for balance and keep a hold on
yourself
But there are people who fall apart more
than that. I think I held it together
but of course I fell apart before and after
that
I want to ask you about our general
culture of dialogue in the Arab media
There's a school which aims to embarrass
the guest
I was going to raise this point with you
There's also a culture of trying to catch
the guest out. Even for me, hosting a
small, humble program
my friends say, Why didn't you ask hard
questions or put him in a corner
I personally don't think it's a
good way to treat any guest, even in the
future
What did you just call him? A guest
What does guest mean? Someone's
coming to your house. You have duties to
the guest, respecting them
Guests on programs, I mean. Broadcast
news is a bit different
So I agree with you. Our program In-Depth
was known for this
The program is a clean, decent platform.
Guests would say it
But personally I think the opposition
at Al Jazeera, has affected our general
culture
No, I don't
Professionally, I don't want to comment
on anyone
I'm talking about In-Depth
I believe the guests find a place that
respects and appreciates them
and deals seriously with their ideas. I
mean my respect for
you, Faisal, and my appreciation or
your respect for me as a guest
and your appreciation
doesn't prevent you from asking me a
serious question or
to confront me with something. Nothing
is stopping you
There's no contradiction between
seriousness, attempting to extract
information
or reveal contradictions and treating your
guest with respect
There's no contradiction between them
but
there are duties towards the guest
and I personally think, and you're probably
the same
our culture and upbringing and
environment
is like this. So I can't have a guest on and
talk to him roughly
I can't do that
Ok, I have a serious question to end things
on
But not too serious. Give us a light one
Just a little serious
Al Jazeera offices were closed in many
Arab states including Kuwait in 2010
which is known for being a welcoming
space for the press
and the reason for the closure is often,
especially in Kuwait
interference in internal affairs. Now my
question is not about
Al Jazeera but about objectively
questioning what is the line between
freedom of the press and interference in
state affairs
in the Arab context? In the end, we're
Arabs and we have certain requirements
even at the personal level. So today, when
is it interfering or not? Where's the line?
It's a relative thing. There's no rule book to
go by
There's a kind of sense or instinct to it
In the end, in my opinion
the journalist doesn't want to be stopped
to always be allowed to do his work
but that's not at the expense of the
quality and seriousness of what is offered
So I can't say that just because they allow
me to have
an office in Kuwait
I'm obliged to do anything
The point is you're trying to keep things
level
you're keeping
the professional line, committed to
objectivity and preserving
a certain quality of issues, but eventually
you're the one making the decision
It's a relative matter
Any journalist in the world makes those
decisions
Am I going to take up this topic which will
lead to major problems or not?
or maybe I come at it from another angle,
and the best is to deal with things
professionally and objectively
because professionalism shouldn't upset
anyone
I mean, you can take the official opinion
but sometimes they stall or don't share in
some states. At all. So if you take up the
topic or something
it could lead to punitive action being
taken against you
So it's a matter of degrees and
consideration
Consideration for the institution
for journalists, for offices and people
Preserving the presence of journalists is
the best for both sides, for the country
because this is very important and reflects
the obligations to freedom
of the press and for
the institution, the newspaper
television. It's important that they exist
Is the press still as influential as before?
Two things happened
It's still influential
This belief that tweeters are influential
is not true
There may be a certain surface effect
to the day's event or the moment. But I'm
talking about a deeper influence
I'm saying that influence may have
diminished a bit
but the pattern of the effect is different.
The media creates the content
The basic content in any social media
communication comes from where?
The media
That's it. Eighty or ninety percent of the
content on social media
Which they pass along
Which is passed along, and talked about,
and argued about
and thought about, and which
determines the issues, who creates it? The
media, the newspapers
I mean, I consider myself a user of social
media
I'm a double agent in a way
I think we control five percent
of the content through social media.
Ninety-five percent
is created by the media. So they
determine what you're going to talk about
What is the cause or issue or topic? It's
the one presented by the media
which then becomes the main thing on
social media
And then it's managed. So the influence of
social media
is on the kind of material provided by the
media or daily follow- up
I mean, no one follows daily
Nowadays
A lot of programs are followed on
Youtube, social media
I mean, the nature of the effect has
mutated but it hasn't transferred over
And those who think the influence is
gone, this is a 200-year old conversation,
Faisal
From when the press first appeared
and then radio, then TV, then the internet,
and then
social media
and other things are going to emerge,
Artificial Intelligence
What's that virtual world on Facebook?
The Metaverse
The belief is that what came before will
end or be destroyed
The media will be around until I retire.
This is very important. This is a threat on
my livelihood
It needs to stay until then. And then,
whatever happens, happens
Thank you so much, Bu Salman. I really
enjoyed this conversation today
I did as well, and Bidon Waraq
Firstly because it's unscripted
and spontaneous and there's been a shift
also in the nature of paper
Today newspapers are read online and
Bidon Waraq represents
our hope, Faisal and this generation
of wonderful young people today who are
doing the job well
and running conversations well. When we
were that age, we didn't do it
and it's all self-initiated
You need public support and interest
I'm not talking about anything official and
more interaction
It's great
and it's a pleasure for me that I could join
you, and best of luck to you all
And thanks to our dear sister, Muneera as
well
thank you, Muneera. All the best, Bu
Salman
God willing, thank you
